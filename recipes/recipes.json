Repeat process with the other half of the ingredients and add to the large bowl.</li><li>By hand: Place all the ingredients in a large bowl and use a pastry cutter to incorporate the butter into the dough. Cut by pressing on butter, then gathering flour onto it in two quick strokes.  Cut until butter slices become pea-sized.</li><li>Dont over process or mix. Dough will be dry. Break large lumps of butter by hand, and toss dry dough with your fingers.</li><li>Blend the cheeses, dill, shallot and pepper with the Scone Mix using a wooden spoon. Drizzle the buttermilk over the dough and drop the cottage cheese in the middle, and stir until mixed. Add more buttermilk if dough is too dry to hold together.</li><li>Place dough on a lightly floured surface and divide into two. Form 2 discs and flatten each to a thickness of about 1-1/2 inches, cut into 6 wedges for a total of 12. Arrange an inch apart on a cookie sheet.</li><li>Bake for 15 minutes, rotate the pan, and bake another 10 to 15 minutes, until scones are light brown on top and darker at the bottom. Bread should no longer be soft and doughy in the center. Bake in 2 batches if scones dont fit in one cookie sheet.</li><li>Serve warm or cool in a wire rack before wrapping in foil or plastic wrap/bag. Freshly baked scones can be kept at room temperature for up to 2 days, and in the refrigerator for a week.</li></ol>"

Season with salt and pepper.</li><li>Heat a large, heavy bottomed pan with the oil. Sprinkle  each side of the lamb loin evenly with salt and pepper.  (This cooking process is exactly like the way you make steak).  Once the oil is hot (it will smoke a little bit), sear the lamb loin, about 2 minutes per side and allow the lamb to cook the rest of the way in the oven. The cooking times are as follows:</li><li>If you like your lamb rare, place it in the oven for no more than 2-3 minutes.  If you like your lamb medium rare place it in the oven for about 6-8 minutes.  If you like your lamb medium place it in the oven for 9 to 11 minutes. If you like it well done leave it in there for 12-14 minutes.  Remember, the lamb will continue to cook after you take it out so plan accordingly.</li></ol>"

Cover with Saran Wrap and place in the fridge to marinade anywhere from 1 to 3 hours.When you are ready to grill, take a cast iron skillet and start sauteing your veggies you want to eat on your fajitas. I chose a red onion thinly sliced, and a red and orange bell pepper, also thinly sliced with a Tbsp of Olive Oil to saute them in. (Have your grill set at 350 degrees.)When your onions start becoming translucent and you have everything close to ready, it's time to grab those marinating skirt steaks and put them on the grillOnce the steaks are on, close the lid and set your timer for 5 minutes. Open the lid, and flip your steaks. This is the part that is fast! After 10 minutes and the steaks are done, remove them from the grill and cover them in foil.Let cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving."

With the motor running, slowly add the liquid ingredients to the flour. Process until combined. Let mixture rest for 10 minutes.</li><li>2. Add salt and process another 30-60 seconds. It will form a sticky dough that should clear the sides of the food processor workbowl.</li><li>3. Scrape dough out onto a floured worksurface and knead just until smooth, about a minute. Form into a ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl (large). Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate 16-24 hours.</li><li>4.After the dough has rested, turn out onto a lightly floured work surface and divide dough into 4 pieces and shape each piece into a ball. Cover lightly with plastic wrap and let rest 15-20 minutes.</li><li>5. Meanwhile melt the butter in a small saucepan, then add the garlic. Set aside.</li><li>6. Roll the first piece of dough out into a 9 inch round. Using a fork, poke the dough all over, 20-25 times. Lightly mist the top side with water.</li><li>6. Heat the remaining oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until the oil begins to shimmer. Wipe the oil out of the skillet with paper towels, then add the rolled out dough, sprayed side down and spray the other side lightly. Cover skillet and cook until spotty brown underneath, 2-4 minutes (poke any large bubbles that form). Flip naan, cook, covered, another 2-3 minutes until browned. Flip again, brush with butter, then transfer to a plate and cover with foil. While rolling out and cooking the remaining naan.</li></ol>"

Stir in the pasta and cook until tender according to the package instructions  about 10 minutes depending on the type of pasta used. Stir often. Drain, reserving the cooking liquid, and rinse the pasta in cold water. Set aside.Heat the oil over medium heat in a medium or large saucepan. When hot, add the onion to the pot and saut for 5 minutes or until softened. Add the carrot and saut for another few minutes. Now add the garlic and chilies, and continue to saut for another minute.Add the cumin, coriander, turmeric and amchoor powder if using, stir for another minute, and then add the tomato. Simmer for a few minutes and then add the herbs and 1 1/4 cups of the reserved pasta cooking liquid. Simmer for another few minutes and then add the peas. Simmer for another 3 to 4 minutes, and then add the chickpeas and pasta. Simmer for another 5 to 7 minutes, adding more water if necessary to achieve desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper and serve with crusty bread or just as is. It's wonderful served at room temperature or slightly warmed. I sprinkled the bowl with some nutritional yeast, but feel free to sprinkle some fresh grated Parmesan overtop if you enjoy cheese."

(See note in About section on where to purchase)</li><li>First boil your eggs, then slide the egg inside the press and screw the top down so it pushes the egg into the corners.</li><li>Let the egg cool and remove it from the mold. For better results use medium size eggs.</li><li>If you intend to prepare this for a party, I suggest you buy several cubers, this way you can boil and chill several eggs at a time, or it will take you a lot of time.</li><li>To prepare hard boiled eggs, place eggs in a saucepan, cover with cold water and bring to a boil over medium heat. As soon as the water comes to a full boil, let the eggs boil for 5 minutes, and then remove from heat and let stand covered in hot water 10 minutes .</li><li>Filling is made with cream cheese, ham and egg yolk, it tastes very soft, it is ideal for kids.</li></ol>"

You could puree this mixture before serving, but I prefer it chunky.</li><li>Chocolate Sauce:</li><li>In a saucepan, add the chocolate chips and cream.</li><li>Allow the chocolate chips to melt, stirring occasionally.</li><li>Remove from heat once chips have melted and add the golden syrup.</li><li>Beignets:</li><li>Heat the 1% milk in a saucepan.</li><li>Once it starts to simmer, remove pan from heat and add the buttermilk.</li><li>Pour milk into a standing mixer.</li><li>To the milk, whisk in the yeast and sugar.  Let sit until foamy, approximately 5 minutes.</li><li>In a separate bowl, mix the flours, baking soda and salt.</li><li>Turn the mixer on low speed and slowly add the flour mixture until just incorporated and dough is in the shape of a ball and is slightly sticky.</li><li>Cover the standing mixer bowl with saran wrap and let sit in a warm, draft-free location for about an hour.</li><li>After an hour, lightly flour your work surface and pour out your dough.</li><li>Using as little flour as possible, fold the dough over in half and tuck in the edges to make a ball.</li><li>Flatten the ball and with a floured rolling pin.</li><li>Roll the ball out into a circle until the circle is about  an inch thick.</li><li>Using a knife or other sharp object cut the dough into any shape you want.  I find that cutting the dough into long and thick logs makes the beignets good for dipping.</li><li>Let sit for a few minutes.</li><li>In the meantime, pour canola oil into a Dutch oven until the oil is about 2-3 inches deep.</li><li>Heat oil to 375 degrees.</li><li>Once oil is hot, drop in the dough  4-5 at a time and turn frequently.</li><li>Allow to fry for 2-3 minutes, or until a lovely golden dark brown.</li><li>Transfer the beignets to a drain on a paper towel lined plate.</li><li>Add some powdered sugar to the brown paper bag and drop in 3-4 beignets.</li><li>Close the bag and shake until the beignets are completely covered in powdered sugar.</li><li>Serve warm with the dipping sauces.</li></ol>"

Set aside.</li><li>Add the sugar to the butter and beat until light and fluffy. Turn the mixer to low and mix in the molasses, egg and balsamic vinegar. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the bowl and continue mixing until thoroughly combined.</li><li>Cover and chill about 2 hours or until the dough is easy to handle.</li><li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees.</li><li>Divide the dough in half and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll each half of the dough to 1/4\" thickness adding flour as needed, the dough is very sticky so use flour liberally to prevent your cutouts from sticking to the surface.</li><li>Using cookie cutters, cut dough into shapes and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment approximately 1\" apart.</li><li>Bake in a 400 degree oven for 5-6 minutes. Cool on baking sheets for one minute and move to a wire rack.</li><li>In a small bowl, combine the powdered sugar, vanilla and milk. Whisk to combine. Spoon mixture into a pastry bag or zip top bag and snip off the tip. Add two small dots of icing where the eyes should be and then press one eye on each dot. Decorate the mummies using a zig-zag pattern across the surface of the cookie and allow to dry for 2-4 hours or overnight.</li><li>Store in an airtight container.</li></ol>"

        "instructions": "<ol><li>In a large bowl, add mustard, bread crumbs, egg, garlic powder, salt and pepper to ground elk meat. Mix all ingredients by hand and then form into small patties. Use a  cup measuring cup to size how much meat to use when forming your patties.  Place meat on tinfoil and press gently with your thumb creating a small indent in the center. This will help keep patties from shrinking when cooking.</li><li>Pre-heat the barbecue to high temperature.</li><li>I recommend leaving the elk burgers on the tinfoil while cooking on the BBQ. The elk meat is very lean and can have the tendency to dry out if overcooked. Cooking on tinfoil reduces the risk of overcooking.</li><li>Cook 7 minutes or until brown and then flip patties. Continue cooking on other side until brown  7 minutes. Add smoked mozzarella cheese to the top of burgers during the last 2 minutes of cooking. Close lid and melt cheese.</li><li>While cooking your burgers, place pancetta bacon slices on tinfoil and place on the barbeque for the last few minutes of cooking. Toast buns on grill.</li><li>Place elk sliders on Hawaiian Sweet Rolls, top with a slice of pancetta bacon and a few cherry tomatoes and you are set! Enjoy!</li></ol>"

Then add the rest of the ingredients for the BBQ sauce to the sauce pan. Simmer for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li><li>Heat a grill over medium-low heat.

No colour is needed on the vegetables, so make sure the heat isnt too high that they become brown, but high enough the vegetables sweat and soften.</li><li>Add the tomato pure and  the thyme leaves, stir through and cook for about 30 seconds.</li><li>3.Add the stock, the tin of tomatoes, fresh tomatoes, and a little salt and pepper. Stir everything through, set the heat so that your soup is on a gentle simmer, cover and cook for about 25 minutes or until the vegetables are cooked al dente.</li><li>Add the pasta and cook until the pasta is ready.  Follow the timing instructions on the packet, but this is normally about 7 minutes.</li><li>Add the cabbage and the beans and cook until the cabbage has wilted.  This will take about 5 minutes.</li><li>Check for seasoning and add some salt and pepper if needed before serving.</li><li>Sprinkle a little parmesan over each bowl of soup.</li></ol>"

        "instructions": "<p>Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F. Poke your sweet potatoes with a fork and place them directly on the rack of your oven. Place a piece of foil on the rack below to reduce mess. Bake the sweet potatoes for 45-50 minutes or until tender. Times may vary depending on how hot your oven gets.Remove the potatoes from the oven and let stand at room temperature until they are cool enough to handle, about 20-30 minutes. Leave the oven on.While your potatoes are cooling, melt the butter over medium heat. Continue to cook the butter, stirring frequently, until brown bits begin to form on the bottom of the pan, about 5-6 minutes. Pay close attention as the butter can quickly go from brown to burnt in a matter of seconds. Once you see the brown bits forming and a nutty aroma fills the air, pull the butter from the heat immediately. Set aside.Cut the tops off of the sweet potatoes, lengthwise. Scoop the sweet potato flesh into a medium bowl, leaving the skins in tact. To the bowl, add the brown butter, 2 tablespoons of the fresh parsley, 3/4 of the chopped bacon, and 4 ounces of the goats cheese. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper to taste and mash the ingredients together until combined. Scoop the filling back into the sweet potatoes.Place the potatoes on a baking sheet that has been lined with foil or parchment paper. Place them back in the oven to bake for 25 minutes.While your potatoes are baking for a second time, prepare your avocado cream. In the bowl of your food processor or blender, combine the avocados, sour cream and buttermilk. Add a dash of salt and pepper and pulse until completely smooth and creamy.Once your potatoes have baked, remove from oven. Sprinkle on the remaining parsley, bacon and goats cheese. Drizzle with avocado cream and serve immediately.Enjoy!I hope you enjoy this recipe for brown butter twice baked sweet potatoes!</p>"

The chicken stock if freshly made will have some oil from the chicken so your rice does not need oil.Increase the heat and stir in the chopped vegetables and pepper. Add your seasoning cube.Finally stir in your cubed mango and serve warm with any protein of your choice. I’d say chicken but it’s up to you."

Combine all of the ingredients thoroughly. Form into desired shapes and sizes (we usually form them into crescents) and bake on greased and floured cookie sheets. Bake for 20-30 minutes depending on thickness of cookie. (In my oven, it takes about 24 minutes).</li><li>NOTES :This recipe is a double recipe. These are one of my favorite cookies-I just LOVE almonds!</li></ol>"

Pour 4 cups of water and 1 tsp. of liquid smoke in a roasting pan.</li><li>Place the ribs in the pan, top up. Tightly cover the pan with foil and bake for 2 hours. Remove from the oven and rest until ready to grill. Meanwhile, add 1 Tb. oil to a sauce pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and saut for 1-2 minutes. Then add the rest of the ingredients for the BBQ sauce to the sauce pan. Simmer for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li><li>Heat a grill over medium-low heat. Brush the ribs completely with BBQ sauce. Place them on the grill and cook for 20 minutes, turning and brushing every 5 minutes until the desired bark has developed.</li><li>It's fun to make your own BBQ sauce.

Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 40 to 60 minutes. Take care not to overcook  the beans should be tender but not be falling apart. Drain and set aside.To prepare the eggplant, cut of the stem and bottom edge and then cut in half lengthwise. Score the flesh into diagonal 1-inch lines, then turn and score again until you have a diagonal pattern. Take care not to cut through the skin. Sprinkle with some salt and let sit for 40 minutes. Rinse and squeeze out any excess water. Brush the eggplant with some oil and transfer to a roasting pan. Bake in a preheated 400 oven until the flesh appears collapsed and is wrinkly. Remove from heat and let cool for about 10 minutes, season with a bit of salt, and remove the flesh from the eggplant. If there is too much water, drain in a strainer. Set aside.Heat the oil over medium heat in the same saucepan used to cook the black-eyed peas. When hot, toss in the shallots and chilies and saut for 2 to 3 minutes. Now add the spices and stir for another minute, until fragrant. Add the tomato, cook for another few minutes, and then add the eggplant and black-eyed peas, and cook for another few minutes, stirring often.Pour a few tablespoons of water into the pan and add handfuls of chard at a time until wilted. Add more water as necessary. Add the lemon juice and salt to taste near the end of the cooking time. Remove from heat, cover, and let sit for a few minutes before serving."

        "instructions": "Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with foil and spray it with a nonstick spray. Season the pork tenderloin generously with the lemon pepper seasoning, rubbing it all over. Place the pork tenderloin on the prepared baking sheet and spray the pork with a nonstick spray. Place it in the oven and roast for about 45 minutes to 1 hour or until done to your liking. Use an instant read thermometer for desired level of doneness. I cooked mine to 145 degrees F for medium rare (see note).While the pork is roasting, prepare your crumbled cornbread. To a large bowl, add the cornbread, egg, jalapeno, parsley, green onions, salt and black pepper to taste, and milk. Stir to combine and pour it into an oven-safe baking dish that has been sprayed with a nonstick spray. Place it in the oven with pork and bake for 20 minutes or until slightly brown on top. Remove from oven and cover with foil to keep warm while you prepare the rest of your meal.When the pork has finished roasting, remove it from the oven and pour the juices (if there are any) into a large nonstick skillet set over medium heat. Cover the pork tenderloin with a foil tent and allow it to rest for 10 minutes. Add the butter to the pan with the juices. If the pork has not released any juices, add an extra tablespoon or two of butter. Melt the butter and then whisk in the flour. Let cook for a minute or until golden brown, then whisk in the chicken broth and continue whisking until the sauce is a thick gravy. Season generously with salt and black pepper to taste. Remove from heat.Slice the pork and set it over a bed of cornbread stuffing.Serve with your favorite veggies and enjoy!"

Add additional coconut flour if the peanut mixture is too soft  it should be pliable and easy to form into shapes with your hands.Using a tablespoon or ice cream scoop, drop spoonfuls of the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Form into balls and flatten each ball slightly with your fingers. Place in the freezer for 20 to 30 minutes until firm.Melt the chocolate in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring often, until melted. Let cool for a few minutes and then dip each of the frozen peanut butter pieces into the chocolate to coat completely. Using a fork is a good way to do this and be sure to work quickly.Transfer each peanut butter cup back to the baking sheet and return to the freezer. Sprinkle with a little coarse sea salt if desired. Chill until set, about 1 hour or more. These will keep well in the freezer for several days, if they last that long.Note: You can make a half batch instead, but these are so good, you won't want to do that, especially as they keep so well."

The wire rack may be placed over a sheet of aluminum foil for easier clean up.</li><li>Place the bread and panko crumbs out on a plate or shallow dish. Place rings one at a time into the crumbs, and scoop the crumbs up over the ring to coat.</li><li>Give it a gentle tap as you remove it from the crumbs. The coating should cling very well. Repeat with remaining rings.I suggest completing this entire step before starting to fry rings. Its very easy to burn them if youre distracted. I may or may not be speaking from experience.</li><li>Deep fry the rings a few at a time for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. They should float to the top immediately  if they dont your oil is not hot enough. Turn rings over once during the frying time.</li><li>Remove form oil and transfer to a paper towel to drain. Season with seasoning salt, and serve warm.</li><li>Preparing Dipping Sauce: Mix Sriracha Chili and Crema thoroughly until completely blended. Use more or less of the chili sauce depending on your heat preference.</li></ol>"

Salt and pepper to taste, then put in the fridge.</li><li>Chop all veggies and set aside.</li><li>Add 1 tablespoon of oil to a small pan over medium-high heat. Add the green onions and allow them to saute for 1-2 minutes. Pour both cans of drained beans into the pan. Bring to a simmer and add the cumin, cayenne and  tsp. of salt. Squeeze a couple of lime wedges into the beans. Cook for 5 minutes longer. Cover and set aside. Top the beans with cheese when you are ready to serve them.</li><li>Heat a large skillet to high heat. Cut the fish into 1 x 3 inch strips. Drizzle oil on the fish, then salt and pepper both sides.</li><li>Pour the cornmeal into a pie pan. Roll the fish strips in cornmeal, shaking off the excess.</li><li>Add 2 tablespoons of oil to pan. When it is hot, cook half the fish strips 1-2 minutes per side, until opaque and flaky. The cooking time will depend on the thickness of the fish. Remove the fish from the pan and place on a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat.</li><li>Warm the tortillas in the microwave. Divide the fish between 8 tortillas. (You can double up the tortillas so they wont break!) Then top each with cabbage, tomatoes, cilantro and jalapeno-lime sauce. Serve with lime wedges and hot sauce, black beans on the side.</li></ol>"

In the soup pot, add the broccoli florets, a dash of veggie broth and saute covered for about a minute until tender. Add the pureed soup back into the soup pot. Add a bay leaf and a few pinches of chopped basil (optional). Simmer uncovered for at least twenty minutes to cook out all the air bubbles. Stir constantly for the first few minutes.

Oil should be about 375 degrees OR when a cube of bread is dropped in the oil, it will brown in 1 minute.</li><li>Add rice balls to hot oil and brown on all sides.  This may have to be done in stages--do NOT crowd the pan!  Fry maybe 6-8 balls at a time so they have plenty of room to move around in the pan.

        "instructions": "<ol><li>Place all of the ingredients, save the last 2 eggs, in a blender and whisk until combined. Pour into a sealable container and set into the fridge overnight.</li><li>In the morning, take your batter out from the fridge and let it sit for about 30 minutes to an hour. Pour about a tablespoon of milk to it and stir around.</li><li>Place a crepe pan on the burner (over medium-high heat) and melt a pat of butter in it (you can use a silicone brush to coat the pan).</li><li>Pour 1/4 cup of batter into the pan and tilt it to swirl the batter around until it coats the pan. Your first crepe is always going to be experimental. The fresh butter might make it a little clumpy or bubbly and it might not cover the pan properly--don't worry, you'll get into the swing of things after 1-2 tries.</li><li>Cook for about one minute or so. Use a spatula to lift an edge--if it's slightly golden, it's time to flip. Once you flip, cook for another 45 seconds or so. The amount of time that you cook the galette depends on many factors: your stove, the type of pan you're using, how thick the batter is, etc. You might also need to adjust the temperature--my crepe pans work best on medium-high heat, but this might be too high for your stove and could burn the crepes. Start with medium heat and increase or decrease, depending on how long the crepes are cooking for. My best advice is to lightly lift the edge of the galette to see if it's starting to change color before flipping. The edges will usually be slightly crisped.</li><li>I usually make about 2-3 galettes before using my silicone brush to add a little more butter to the pan. I like to use the brush because it guarantees even coverage and never creates big clumps of butter that cause the batter to curl in places. The galettes should peel off the pan easily.</li><li>To keep the galettes warm as you cook more, here's a trick: set a big pot of water on a nearby skillet. Top with a large plate and bring to a boil. Place the done galettes on the plate--the boiling water underneath keeps the plate warm.</li><li>So, considering this recipe makes about 10 galettes--that means two people could each eat 4 galettes on their own (or with a swipe of jam or Nutella and some berries on the side) and each have a galette topped with an egg.</li><li>When you're done making all of the galettees, place one back onto your crepe pan. Carefully crack one egg into the center. Use a fork to sort of spread the egg whites around the entire galette (but be careful to not disturb the yolk!). Salt and pepper. At this time, you could also throw in some cheese--shaved Parmesan, or maybe some Gruyere. When the whites have thickened and are universally white, use a spatula to lift the sides of the crepes and gently fold over as you would an envelope, but leave a nice center hole for the yolk. Slide your spatula under and place on a plate.</li></ol>"

Saute the vegetables over medium heat for about 20 minutes.Add in the sliced sausage and continue to saute for about 10-12 minutes. Constantly stirring.While the veggies and sausage are cooking, sprinkle the salt, remaining tsp of cayenne, white pepper, and oregano over the chicken.Once the sausage has been cooked, add in the seasoned chicken breasts and cook for 8-10 minutes, constantly stirring.Pour the rice into the chicken and sausage mixture and stir to coat really well, for about 2 minutes.Turn the heat down to medium/low and then add the 6 cups of water, stir, and then cover for the remaining 30 to 35 minutes. Do not stir for 30 minutes. You may have to cook a little longer if you are using a brown rice in this recipe. Cook until all of the water is gone and the rice is fully cooked.Let stand for 5 minutes before serving."

        "instructions": "<ol><li>Place all of the ingredients, save the last 2 eggs, in a blender and whisk until combined. Pour into a sealable container and set into the fridge overnight.</li><li>In the morning, take your batter out from the fridge and let it sit for about 30 minutes to an hour. Pour about a tablespoon of milk to it and stir around.</li><li>Place a crepe pan on the burner (over medium-high heat) and melt a pat of butter in it (you can use a silicone brush to coat the pan).</li><li>Pour 1/4 cup of batter into the pan and tilt it to swirl the batter around until it coats the pan. Your first crepe is always going to be experimental. The fresh butter might make it a little clumpy or bubbly and it might not cover the pan properly--don't worry, you'll get into the swing of things after 1-2 tries.</li><li>Cook for about one minute or so. Use a spatula to lift an edge--if it's slightly golden, it's time to flip. Once you flip, cook for another 45 seconds or so. The amount of time that you cook the galette depends on many factors: your stove, the type of pan you're using, how thick the batter is, etc. You might also need to adjust the temperature--my crepe pans work best on medium-high heat, but this might be too high for your stove and could burn the crepes. Start with medium heat and increase or decrease, depending on how long the crepes are cooking for. My best advice is to lightly lift the edge of the galette to see if it's starting to change color before flipping. The edges will usually be slightly crisped.</li><li>I usually make about 2-3 galettes before using my silicone brush to add a little more butter to the pan. I like to use the brush because it guarantees even coverage and never creates big clumps of butter that cause the batter to curl in places. The galettes should peel off the pan easily.</li><li>To keep the galettes warm as you cook more, here's a trick: set a big pot of water on a nearby skillet. Top with a large plate and bring to a boil. Place the done galettes on the plate--the boiling water underneath keeps the plate warm.</li><li>So, considering this recipe makes about 10 galettes--that means two people could each eat 4 galettes on their own (or with a swipe of jam or Nutella and some berries on the side) and each have a galette topped with an egg.</li><li>When you're done making all of the galettees, place one back onto your crepe pan. Carefully crack one egg into the center. Use a fork to sort of spread the egg whites around the entire galette (but be careful to not disturb the yolk!). Salt and pepper. At this time, you could also throw in some cheese--shaved Parmesan, or maybe some Gruyere. When the whites have thickened and are universally white, use a spatula to lift the sides of the crepes and gently fold over as you would an envelope, but leave a nice center hole for the yolk. Slide your spatula under and place on a plate.</li></ol>"

I like leaving a bit of stem with the leaves to give better structure to the wraps.</li><li>Chop the cauliflower into small pieces and pulse them in a food processor until it looks like rice. I usually pulse the cauliflower florets and the stalk together.</li><li>Place the olive oil in a saut pan over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the garlic and let it fry for about a minute or two, or until the garlic starts to brown. Add the pulsed cauliflower rice and cook it for about 2-3 minutes. The cauliflower should turn into a vibrant yellow-orange color when it is cooked. Add a pinch of salt and chopped basil to the cauliflower and stir.</li><li>Spiralize the zucchini with Blade B to create zucchini noodles. If you do not have a spiralizer, just create zucchini ribbons with a vegetable peeler.</li><li>To assemble the wraps, place a large leaf flat down. Add a bit of sauted cauliflower, zucchini noodles, red pepper, and avocado along the swiss chard stalk. Drizzle a bit of vinaigrette on top of the vegetables and wrap everything up.</li><li>Enjoy these wraps as a side to your favorite protein! Feel free to dip these wraps in more sauce.</li><li>These wraps are best consumed when they are freshly made. Refrigerate any leftovers in an airtight container.</li></ol>"

        "instructions": "<ol><li>Place all of the ingredients, save the last 2 eggs, in a blender and whisk until combined. Pour into a sealable container and set into the fridge overnight.</li><li>In the morning, take your batter out from the fridge and let it sit for about 30 minutes to an hour. Pour about a tablespoon of milk to it and stir around.</li><li>Place a crepe pan on the burner (over medium-high heat) and melt a pat of butter in it (you can use a silicone brush to coat the pan).</li><li>Pour 1/4 cup of batter into the pan and tilt it to swirl the batter around until it coats the pan. Your first crepe is always going to be experimental. The fresh butter might make it a little clumpy or bubbly and it might not cover the pan properly--don't worry, you'll get into the swing of things after 1-2 tries.</li><li>Cook for about one minute or so. Use a spatula to lift an edge--if it's slightly golden, it's time to flip. Once you flip, cook for another 45 seconds or so. The amount of time that you cook the galette depends on many factors: your stove, the type of pan you're using, how thick the batter is, etc. You might also need to adjust the temperature--my crepe pans work best on medium-high heat, but this might be too high for your stove and could burn the crepes. Start with medium heat and increase or decrease, depending on how long the crepes are cooking for. My best advice is to lightly lift the edge of the galette to see if it's starting to change color before flipping. The edges will usually be slightly crisped.</li><li>I usually make about 2-3 galettes before using my silicone brush to add a little more butter to the pan. I like to use the brush because it guarantees even coverage and never creates big clumps of butter that cause the batter to curl in places. The galettes should peel off the pan easily.</li><li>To keep the galettes warm as you cook more, here's a trick: set a big pot of water on a nearby skillet. Top with a large plate and bring to a boil. Place the done galettes on the plate--the boiling water underneath keeps the plate warm.</li><li>So, considering this recipe makes about 10 galettes--that means two people could each eat 4 galettes on their own (or with a swipe of jam or Nutella and some berries on the side) and each have a galette topped with an egg.</li><li>When you're done making all of the galettees, place one back onto your crepe pan. Carefully crack one egg into the center. Use a fork to sort of spread the egg whites around the entire galette (but be careful to not disturb the yolk!). Salt and pepper. At this time, you could also throw in some cheese--shaved Parmesan, or maybe some Gruyere. When the whites have thickened and are universally white, use a spatula to lift the sides of the crepes and gently fold over as you would an envelope, but leave a nice center hole for the yolk. Slide your spatula under and place on a plate.</li></ol>"

        "instructions": "<ol><li>Have all the ingredients ready for assembly. In a large bowl filled with water, dip a wrapper in the water. The rice wrapper will begin to soften and this is your cue to remove it from the water and lay it flat. Place 2 shrimp halves in a row across the center and top with basil, mint, cilantro and lettuce. Leave about 1 to 2 inches uncovered on each side.  Fold uncovered sides inward, then tightly roll the wrapper, beginning at the end with the lettuce.  Repeat with remaining wrappers and ingredients. Cut and serve at room temperature with dipping sauce.</li><li>The Culinary Chases Note: The rice wrapper can be fussy to handle if you let it soak too long. I usually give it a couple of swishes in the water and then remove. It may feel slightly stiff but by the time you are ready to roll up, the wrapper will become very pliable.  A typical spring roll contains cooked rice vermicelli, slivers of cooked pork and julienned carrots but you can use whatever suits your fancy.  Enjoy!</li></ol>"

        "instructions": "Yes, these are called SPICY hot wings for a reason. I like adding the brown sugar to give them a little sweeter taste, but it is by far a delicious spicy recipe more than anything.To get started, mix the brown sugar, crushed garlic, hot sauce, and cayenne pepper into a medium mixing bowl. Mix well and then set aside.Take the cooking spray and spray the entire inside portion of the slow cooker AND also the wings. (Spraying the wings before you grill, bake, or cook chicken keeps the flavor and makes them super juicy. TRUST ME.)Take the wings and add them into the mixing bowl with your spices and toss to get a good even coat over the wings.Place in the slow cooker on low for 4 hours. After 4hours, remove carefully and place on a prepared cookie sheet. Place in the oven under broiler setting for 4-6 minutes, allowing the wings to get a little crisp.Serve immediately with a little blue cheese dressing and celery."

Blend the chunks of coconut milk with a hand mixer on high speed for 15-20 seconds, just until the mixture turns to liquid. Sift in the powdered sugar (amount depends on how sweet you like it) and mix until combined. Add the vanilla extract and blend on high speed for 1-2 minutes, until light and creamy. Whipped cream is best served immideately, but can be stored in an air tight container for up to three days. It will harden in the fridge, so when ready to serve, simply blend with a hand mixer on high speed until creamy again.</li></ol>"

You can cook them all at once to avoid having one sit aside for too long.(Prepare your potatoes and set aside) Meanwhile, boil your noodles but reduce cooking time by 4 minutes to avoid overcooking. Drain and set aside. Prepare your onions by cooking in the 4 tbsp. of butter over medium heat until tender.Add milk, 1 cup of cheese, salt and pepper, and onion mixture to your potatoes. Mash using a large wooden spoon or a hand held potato masher. Mash until soft, but some chunks remain. You don't want a completely smooth texture. Add in your noodles and toss to coat. Taste for seasoning and add more if necessary. If mixture seems dry, add more milk and butter until the entire mixture is lightly coated. Place in casserole dish. Sprinkle with the remaining  cup of cheese. Bake in your preheated oven for 25 minutes or until cheese starts to bubble. Serve immediately and enjoy!"

Just before putting the salmon in the oven, drizzle the lemon juice over the fish.

Wash the asparagus and cut off the bottom inch and a half of each stalk and discard.  Spread the asparagus on in a large skillet. Drizzle the lemon grapeseed oil over the asparagus and spread the oil on the asparagus with your hands so that all stalks are completely coated.  Sprinkle asparagus with desired amount of salt and pepper. Saut over medium heat for 5 minutes. Add the two tablespoons of vegetable stock and cover the skillet. Saut 4 minutes. Remove lid and add the minced garlic. Place cover back over the asparagus. Continue cooking an additional 3 to 5 minutes until asparagus is cooked but not too soft.

To a second shallow bowl, add the egg wash (2 eggs mixed with 1 tablespoon of water); and to a third shallow bowl, combine the bread crumbs, salt, garlic powder and cayenne pepper.Dredge the chicken strips in the flour, shaking to get rid of any excess. Transfer to the egg wash and fully coat. Finally, place the chicken strips in the panko bread crumb mixture and press to adhere where necessary. Place the chicken strips on the prepared baking sheet and spray generously with a non-stick spray. Bake for 20-22 minutes or until crispy, brown and cooked through.While the chicken is cooking, prepare your sauce. In a medium saucepan, whisk together the brown sugar, cayenne pepper sauce and butter. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, and then remove from heat.Once the chicken has cooked, toss it in the sauce. Serve immediately with ranch. Enjoy!"

Use a  cup measuring cup to size how much meat to use when forming your patties.  Place meat on tinfoil and press gently with your thumb creating a small indent in the center. This will help keep patties from shrinking when cooking.</li><li>Pre-heat the barbecue to high temperature.</li><li>I recommend leaving the elk burgers on the tinfoil while cooking on the BBQ. The elk meat is very lean and can have the tendency to dry out if overcooked. Cooking on tinfoil reduces the risk of overcooking.</li><li>Cook 7 minutes or until brown and then flip patties. Continue cooking on other side until brown  7 minutes. Add smoked mozzarella cheese to the top of burgers during the last 2 minutes of cooking. Close lid and melt cheese.</li><li>While cooking your burgers, place pancetta bacon slices on tinfoil and place on the barbeque for the last few minutes of cooking. Toast buns on grill.</li><li>Place elk sliders on Hawaiian Sweet Rolls, top with a slice of pancetta bacon and a few cherry tomatoes and you are set! Enjoy!</li></ol>"

Pulse 8-9 times until completely broken up. With the food processor running, slowly pour in the olive oil until the pesto just comes together. Season to taste with salt and black pepper and transfer to a large bowl.In the same food processor bowl (wipe clean if you wish), combine the yogurt and cilantro. Pulse until the two ingredients come together. Season to taste with salt and black pepper and set aside.Have an ice bath ready. Add the snap peas and beans to the boiling water and blanch for about 1 minute and 30 seconds. Drain and transfer immediately to the ice bath to cool down. Drain again once the veggies are cool, and pat them dry. Add the veggies to the bowl with the pesto and toss to coat.Pour the veggies onto a large platter and drizzle with the cilantro cream. Top with micro greens and sliced almonds. Enjoy immediately or place in the refrigerator to chill."

Using the flat side of a meat mallet, gently pound the chicken to 1/4-inch thickness, taking care to not tear or create holes in the meat.</li><li>Lay 2 slices of cheese on each breast, followed by 2 slices of ham, and 2 more of cheese; leaving a 1/2-inch margin on all sides to help seal the roll. Tuck in the sides of the breast and roll up tight like a jellyroll. Squeeze the log gently to seal.</li><li>Season the flour with salt and pepper; spread out on waxed paper or in a flat dish. Mix the breadcrumbs with thyme, kosher salt, pepper, and oil. The oil will help the crust brown. Beat together the eggs and water, the mixture should be fluid. Lightly dust the chicken with flour, then dip in the egg mixture. Gently coat in the bread crumbs.</li><li>Carefully transfer the roulades to a baking pan and bake for 20 minutes until browned and cooked through.</li><li>Serve whole or cut into pinwheels.</li></ol>"

Drizzle the buttermilk over the dough and drop the cottage cheese in the middle, and stir until mixed. Add more buttermilk if dough is too dry to hold together.</li><li>Place dough on a lightly floured surface and divide into two. Form 2 discs and flatten each to a thickness of about 1-1/2 inches, cut into 6 wedges for a total of 12. Arrange an inch apart on a cookie sheet.</li><li>Bake for 15 minutes, rotate the pan, and bake another 10 to 15 minutes, until scones are light brown on top and darker at the bottom. Bread should no longer be soft and doughy in the center. Bake in 2 batches if scones dont fit in one cookie sheet.</li><li>Serve warm or cool in a wire rack before wrapping in foil or plastic wrap/bag. Freshly baked scones can be kept at room temperature for up to 2 days, and in the refrigerator for a week.</li></ol>"

When cooled add the melted ice cream</li><li>For the caramel-cream: Place 1 cup sugar and water in a 2 quart pot with a glass lid. Cover and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Do not remove lid or stir the sugar mixture or it will begin to crystallize. The glass lid is a convenient way of watching the sugar so you know when it changes color as well as keeping the steam inside and preventing crystallization.</li><li>When the sugar begins to look caramelized watch it carefully and remove from heat when it reaches deep amber color. Be very careful as the sugar is extremely hot and also watch that it doesn't burn. It can go from amber to burnt very quickly.</li><li>Immediately off the heat pour the one cup cream into the caramel. The caramel will stiffen, sizzle and splatter so be careful. Return to a medium heat and cook until the caramel melts together with the cream.</li><li>Pour the caramel cream into the coffee and refrigerate until cold.</li><li>To assemble, fill a glass with ice, scoop two ice cream scoops into each glass.</li><li>Pour the iced espresso cream over and top with sweetened whipped cream (the other cup of cream whipped with 1 tablespoon sugar).</li><li>Garnish with caramel syrup and serve chilled.</li></ol>"

The mixture should be a smooth, semi-thick batter that is of pouring consistency. Add a little water if necessary. Cover and set aside while you prepare the rest of the food.Now prepare the sauce. Whisk together all of the ingredients and set aside.For the filling, combine the carrot, radish, green onions, green chilies and snow peas. Put the herbs in another bowl and have your sprouts ready along with the mushrooms.Heat a teaspoon of oil over medium heat in a non-stick skillet. When hot, ladle 1/2 cup of batter into the pan and spread with the bottom of the ladle until you have a roughly 6 to 8 inch pancake.  Fry for 6 to 8 minutes or until you have small holes forming and the bottom is crispy brown, then flip and fry for another few minutes on the other side. Transfer to a plate and keep warm in a 150 oven while you finish the rest of the pancakes  you should finish with 4 to 6 pancakes.To serve, scatter a portion of the vegetables, herbs and mushrooms over one half of the pancake. Sprinkle some sauce over top and fold the pancake. Drizzle with more sauce and there you go."

Slowly whisk in the polenta, whisking continuously until there are no lumps and it begins to thicken slightly. Reduce the heat to medium-low and allow the polenta to simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to keep it from overcooking.</li><li>When the polenta has thickened and become tender, stir in the goat cheese and cream cheese. Stir until the cheese are melted and fully incorporated into the polenta. Add salt and pepper to taste.</li><li>Meanwhile, place the bacon on a parchment-lined baking sheet and place in the preheated oven on the middle rack. Roast for 15-18 minutes or until the bacon is golden and crisp. When it is done, remove it from the oven and place the bacon strips on a paper towel-lined plate. Set aside.</li><li>In a small saucepan or in the microwave, heat the marinara sauce until just simmering. Keep warm until you are ready to assemble your bowls.</li><li>In a large non-stick skillet, heat the 1 T olive oil over medium heat. If your pan is large enough, add the four eggs and allow them to cook until the whites are opaque but still a bit runny on the top. Put a lid over the pan and turn off the heat. Allow the eggs to continue cooking under the lid until the whites are set but the yolk is still runny. If your pan is small, fry the eggs in batches.</li><li>To assemble the bowls, spoon even amounts of polenta in each bowl. Top with a spoonful of the arrabiata, 1 egg and 2 slices of bacon. Garnish with chopped thyme or parsley leaves. Serve immediately.</li></ol>"

In a heavy-bottomed pot (I love my Le Creuset), add sugar, water and corn syrup over medium-high heat. Let mixture bubble and stir occasionally, to evaporate water. Sugar will begin to caramelize and turn a lovely shade of amber.</li><li>Use a thermometer to monitor caramel. When it reaches 320 degrees and is golden brown in color, slowly whisk in cream, butter and vanilla, until completely combined. When caramel reaches 243 degrees, remove from heat and pour into lined baking sheet. Cool for 15 minutes, and add bacon strips. Cool further, until caramel is pliable and easier to handle.</li><li>Roll caramel and bacon strips jelly-roll style once, and trim off excess. Continue to roll and trim until youve finished off the pan. Cut the bacon caramel logs into bite-sized pieces. Top with reserved bacon bits.</li><li>Serve on a platter, or roll in wax paper. Keep refrigerated, but let come to room temperature before eating.http://www.fureyandthefeast.com/2009/09/bacon-caramels/</li></ol>"

You can leave the ribs whole if you like the way they look better--I just think they are easier to handle on the grill in smaller pieces! Pour 4 cups of water and 1 tsp. of liquid smoke in a roasting pan.</li><li>Place the ribs in the pan, top up. Tightly cover the pan with foil and bake for 2 hours. Remove from the oven and rest until ready to grill. Meanwhile, add 1 Tb. oil to a sauce pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and saut for 1-2 minutes. Then add the rest of the ingredients for the BBQ sauce to the sauce pan. Simmer for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li><li>Heat a grill over medium-low heat. Brush the ribs completely with BBQ sauce. Place them on the grill and cook for 20 minutes, turning and brushing every 5 minutes until the desired bark has developed.</li><li>It's fun to make your own BBQ sauce. But in a pinch, buy a bottled variety you like and simmer for a few minutes with the coffee granules!</li></ol>"

Use a spatula to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl, then scrape the batter out onto a work surface, and use your hands to fully incorporate all the ingredients.</li><li>Scoop mounds of dough about 3 tablespoons in size onto the baking sheet, leaving 3 inches between them, or about 6 to a sheet.</li><li>Bake the cookies for 16 to 20 minutes, rotating the sheets halfway through, until the cookies are evenly brown.</li><li>Transfer the cookies, still on the parchment, to the counter to cool. Give them a quick sprinkling with a pinch of sea salt.</li><li>Repeat with the remaining dough.</li><li>These cookies are best eaten warm from the oven or later that same day. They also keep beautifully in the freezer, either by freezing the dough or freezing the cookies once they're cooled. 20-30 seconds in the microwave is all you need to warm one up!</li></ol>"

Alternating slightly, lay the strips of bacon across the rack, one end in the middle and allowing the other end to hang over the side of the dish.

Set aside.</li><li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the remaining ingredients with the onion/garlic mixture and the remaining tomato paste and gently but thoroughly mix with your hands.  Form into a loaf directly on top of the bacon, leaving enough of the bacon uncovered to wrap the top of the meatloaf.  Spoon the glaze over the top of the meatloaf and spread down the sides, covering it completely.  Lift the ends of the bacon hanging down the sides and place over the top of the meatloaf.</li><li>Bake for an hour, or until the meatloaf is cooked through and the bacon is brown and crisp.

The chicken stock if freshly made will have some oil from the chicken so your rice does not need oil.Increase the heat and stir in the chopped vegetables and pepper. Add your seasoning cube.Finally stir in your cubed mango and serve warm with any protein of your choice. I’d say chicken but it’s up to you."

        "instructions": "Prepare a cookie sheet by greasing with non-stick cooking spray. Preheat oven to 350. Cream butter and sugar together in your mixer, scraping the sides of your bowl. Add your egg and mix well. Mix in baking powder, baking soda, Kool-Aid and cornstarch. Once its well mixed (the Kool-Aid will be mixed once it turns your dough pink), add a drop of pink food coloring, if more color is desired. Next, start adding your flour a half cup at a time until its all added.Roll the dough into walnut-sized balls and roll in the powder sugar, giving them a light coating. Place 2 apart on a room-temp baking sheet (let your sheet cool in between batches if you are reusing the same one).Bake in the oven 9-10 minutes, they wont brown too much, so watch them closely. Over-baking will make them hard and crunchy!I hope you enjoy these! I will be baking another batch soon, we have a neighborhood barbecue coming up and I know these will be perfect!Want more Whistle and Ivy? Subscribe here!

Pulse until the mushrooms are finely minced and all of the ingredients are well combined. It will help if youve given the mushrooms a bit of a rough chop first, or if you use pre-sliced mushrooms.</li><li>Place a won ton wrapper on your work surface, turned so that it appears to be a diamond shape.</li><li>Place a teaspoon of filling in the middle of the wrapper.</li><li>Dip a fingertip into the bowl of water and trace along the two edges farthest from you. Bring up the end closest to you, fold over the filling, and pinch the edges together to seal. Make sure youve gently pressed the wrapper around the filling so there are no air pockets.</li><li>Stand up your little triangle pocket so that the filling side sits on your work surface. Fold the top point down, away from you, and pinch. Now, give the edges on either side of that fold 2 little pleats and pinch. Your pot sticker will now look like it has wings. Place it on a large plate thats been dusted with a bit of cornstarch, to prevent sticking.  (Traditionally, pot stickers are made with round dumpling wrappers, so if you have them, you can skip the part about folding the top point down.)</li><li>Heat the skillet over medium-high heat. Brush just a few drops of oil onto the hot pan surface, and place 12 of the pot stickers, upright, into the pan. Allow the bottoms to brown. Carefully add 1/2 cup water to the pan and cover it quickly. Cook for about 3-4 minutes, or until all of the water has been absorbed. Remove the pot stickers immediately to another plate to keep warm, and repeat the procedure with the rest of the uncooked ones.</li><li>*Feel like you have to have meat? Substitute 4 oz. of ground chicken (or pork, if you must) for half of the mushrooms, just dont run it through the food processor. Mix the processed ingredients with the ground chicken thoroughly and fill the wrappers as before. Add a full cup of water (instead of 1/2 cup) to the pan, and steam until the water evaporates, about 5-6 minutes.</li></ol>"

Cover, bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 4 minutes. Take off the heat and let stand, covered, for 10 minutes to gently finish cooking the fish. Lift the fish out of the milk with a slotted spoon and put on a plate to cool.</li><li>Meanwhile, cook the potatoes in the salted water for 10 minutes or until tender, but not broken up. Drain the potatoes and leave them for a minute or two.</li><li>Tip them back into the hot pan on the lowest heat and let them dry out for 1 minute, mashing them with a fork and stirring so they don't stick. You should have a light, dry fluffy mash. Take off the heat and beat in 1 tablespoon of the sauce, then the lemon zest, parsley, pepper and chives. Set aside.</li><li>Drain off liquid from the fish, then flake it into big chunks into the pan of potatoes. Using your hands, gently lift the fish and potatoes together so they just mix. Do it with only a couple of turns, or the fish will break up too much. Put to aside and cool.</li><li>Beat the egg on a large plate and lightly flour a board. Spread the breadcrumbs on another plate. On the floured board, and with floured hands, carefully shape into 4-6 cakes, about 2.5 cm thick. One by one, put each cake in the egg, and brush over the top and sides so it is completely coated. Transfer each cake to the plate with bread crumbs, pat the crumbs on the sides and tops so they are lightly covered. Transfer to a plate, cover and chill for 30 minutes (or up to a day ahead).</li><li>Fry the fish cakes in hot oil over a medium heat for about 5 minutes on each side or until crisp and golden. Serve with the rest of the sauce (squeeze in a little lemon zest to taste) and lemon wedges for squeezing over.</li></ol>"

If pieces remain after you have stirred it for a while then return to microwave for another few seconds and then stir again until it is fully melted. Be careful not to overheat the chocolate. You are better off starting with less time and reheating than overheating and ruining it.</li><li>When chocolate has melted add the sugar and vanilla and stir with a whisk to combine. Let it cool a little and then add the eggs, one at a time, whisking after each addition. Don't add the eggs when the chocolate is hot because it may cook the whites.</li><li>Once the eggs are mixed in, place the flour in a strainer and sift over the chocolate mixture, a little at a time, mixing it in as you sift it over. Set aside while you prepare the cream cheese layer.</li><li>For the cream cheese layer, place the cream cheese in a bowl and mix with a hand mixer for a couple of minutes until soft.</li><li>Add the sugar and mix to blend it in.</li><li>Add egg and beat to incorporate.</li><li>Add Bailey's and stir it in.</li><li>To assemble, spray an 8\" square baking pan with straight sides with non-stick spray, or butter and flour it. You can also line the baking pan with parchment, leaving the edges high so you can lift the entire cake out of the pan.</li><li>Pour the chocolate mixture into the pan and tilt it to spread it out evenly.</li><li>Pour the cream cheese mixture over it, and with a fork, swirl the layers so some of the chocolate shows on top and the cream cheese layer becomes part of the chocolate layer. Do not over mix - you just want some swirls.</li><li>Place in a preheated 350 degree F oven and bake for 35 minutes or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Do not over bake.</li><li>Remove from oven and let cool before cutting into squares.</li></ol>"

Add the curry leaves or bay leaf and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 1 hour or until the beans are tender but not falling apart. Drain and transfer to a large salad bowl.Meanwhile, snap the woody ends off of the asparagus spears and steam the spears for 6 minutes or until just tender but still retaining their crunch. Transfer to the salad bowl.Now cook the mushrooms. Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat. As soon as the oil is hot, drop in the mushrooms and cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes or until the mushrooms begin to brown and lose some of their liquid. Transfer to the bowl with the asparagus.To make the dressing, combine the tarragon, lemon zest, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil and mustard in a small food processor or blender. Process until smooth.Pour the dressing over the salad, season with salt and pepper, and toss. Serve at room temperature or chilled."

Repeat process with the other half of the ingredients and add to the large bowl.</li><li>By hand: Place all the ingredients in a large bowl and use a pastry cutter to incorporate the butter into the dough. Cut by pressing on butter, then gathering flour onto it in two quick strokes.  Cut until butter slices become pea-sized.</li><li>Dont over process or mix. Dough will be dry. Break large lumps of butter by hand, and toss dry dough with your fingers.</li><li>Blend the cheeses, dill, shallot and pepper with the Scone Mix using a wooden spoon. Drizzle the buttermilk over the dough and drop the cottage cheese in the middle, and stir until mixed. Add more buttermilk if dough is too dry to hold together.</li><li>Place dough on a lightly floured surface and divide into two. Form 2 discs and flatten each to a thickness of about 1-1/2 inches, cut into 6 wedges for a total of 12. Arrange an inch apart on a cookie sheet.</li><li>Bake for 15 minutes, rotate the pan, and bake another 10 to 15 minutes, until scones are light brown on top and darker at the bottom. Bread should no longer be soft and doughy in the center. Bake in 2 batches if scones dont fit in one cookie sheet.</li><li>Serve warm or cool in a wire rack before wrapping in foil or plastic wrap/bag. Freshly baked scones can be kept at room temperature for up to 2 days, and in the refrigerator for a week.</li></ol>"

(See note in About section on where to purchase)</li><li>First boil your eggs, then slide the egg inside the press and screw the top down so it pushes the egg into the corners.</li><li>Let the egg cool and remove it from the mold. For better results use medium size eggs.</li><li>If you intend to prepare this for a party, I suggest you buy several cubers, this way you can boil and chill several eggs at a time, or it will take you a lot of time.</li><li>To prepare hard boiled eggs, place eggs in a saucepan, cover with cold water and bring to a boil over medium heat. As soon as the water comes to a full boil, let the eggs boil for 5 minutes, and then remove from heat and let stand covered in hot water 10 minutes .</li><li>Filling is made with cream cheese, ham and egg yolk, it tastes very soft, it is ideal for kids.</li></ol>"

This step is important in order to get the ginger pulp and juices to infuse into the marinade. In a zip-lock bag (or bowl that you can cover) add the halibut fillets and marinade. Allow the fish to marinate for at least 20 minutes, but several hours is preferred if you are able to do this step ahead of time.</li><li>Set your oven to broil, allow it to warm up then place the fish in a casserole dish with all of the marinade.  Place the casserole dish on one of the top racks and allow to bake about 10-12 minutes, until there is a nice brown glaze on top and fish is cooked all the way through.</li><li>To make the ginger peach relish, combine the chopped peach, red onion, jalapeno, apple cider vinegar, the juice of the half lime, and 1 tablespoon of ginger in a bowl, stir and refrigerate until ready to use.  Allowing the relish to sit for a few hours before consuming gives the flavors time to combine.</li></ol>"

Blend the chunks of coconut milk with a hand mixer on high speed for 15-20 seconds, just until the mixture turns to liquid. Sift in the powdered sugar (amount depends on how sweet you like it) and mix until combined. Add the vanilla extract and blend on high speed for 1-2 minutes, until light and creamy. Whipped cream is best served immideately, but can be stored in an air tight container for up to three days. It will harden in the fridge, so when ready to serve, simply blend with a hand mixer on high speed until creamy again.</li></ol>"

You can leave the ribs whole if you like the way they look better--I just think they are easier to handle on the grill in smaller pieces! Pour 4 cups of water and 1 tsp. of liquid smoke in a roasting pan.</li><li>Place the ribs in the pan, top up. Tightly cover the pan with foil and bake for 2 hours. Remove from the oven and rest until ready to grill. Meanwhile, add 1 Tb. oil to a sauce pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and saut for 1-2 minutes. Then add the rest of the ingredients for the BBQ sauce to the sauce pan. Simmer for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li><li>Heat a grill over medium-low heat. Brush the ribs completely with BBQ sauce. Place them on the grill and cook for 20 minutes, turning and brushing every 5 minutes until the desired bark has developed.</li><li>It's fun to make your own BBQ sauce. But in a pinch, buy a bottled variety you like and simmer for a few minutes with the coffee granules!</li></ol>"

Press mixture firmly into the bottom of two 6 Springform pans coated with cooking spray. Bake for 15 minutes; cool on a wire rack.</li><li>3. To prepare the filling, using an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Add the sugar then the salt. Beat in the eggs, 1 at a time. Next add the sour cream, lemon juice and zest. Beat until thoroughly mixed. (Make sure you get the cream cheese mixed in from the bottom of the mixing bowl.)</li><li>4. Pour the filling into the two Springform pans. Do not fill to the very top as the mixture expands a little bit. If you have a small amount of mixture left over just bake it in a small baking dish.</li><li>5. Fill an 11x13 (approx.) with water on a lower rack in the oven. On the middle rack, above the water pan, place the two Springform pans. Place in 300* oven for 1 hour and 10 minutes. After 35 minutes, reverse the position of the two pans if they are in two different areas of the oven, such as one in front of the other.</li><li>6. Turn the oven off and leave the cheesecakes in the oven for another hour.  Remove from oven and cool to room temperature on a wire rack.</li><li>7. When cheesecakes are at room temperature, place them in the refrigerator for 8 hours or overnight.</li><li>8. Before removing from pan, use a knife to cut around the pan sides. Then open the clasp on the Springform and release the cheesecake. Place it on a serving plate with the bottom of the Springform pan underneath.</li></ol>"

In the mean time place the Nutella and peanut butter into a large glass bowl and microwave for about 20 seconds just to loosen them up. Pour 1/3 of the egg mixture into the Nutella and fold in until no egg remains, do this step two more times until all of the egg is well incorporated into the Nutella. Divide the batter between the 4 ramekins dishes then place onto a baking sheet for easy transport in and out of the oven. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Garnish with some chocolate shavings, whipped topping or a few sliced berries, these little cakes can be served warm, room temp or cold.</li></ol>"

Remove bacon to a paper towel-lined plate.</li><li>To the fat in the pan, add the potato skins and cook until crisp about 10 min. (You want to be sure they are crisp, or else they'll just be soggy and greasy, I took mine out at just the 10 minute mark and they weren't truly crisp, so I just spread them out on a cookie sheet and baked them in a 400 degree oven for around 5 minutes and they were very crisp after that.)</li><li>Remove the crisped potato skins to the paper-lined plate with the bacon. Add the onion to the fat remaining in the pan, cook until tender and lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Add the thyme and flour, cook and stir for about a minute. Slowly whisk in the chicken broth and the half n half. Add the potatoes and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and cook until the potatoes are very tender, (you should be able to easly crush a piece of potato against the side of the pot with the back of a wooden spoon) about 10-15 minutes.</li><li>Using a blender, puree (in small batches) all but about 3 cups of the soup. Using a potato masher or your wooden spoon, lightly crush the potato chunks in the reserved potion of the soup. Add the pureed soup back to the pot and return to a low burner to keep the soup hot. Add in the 2 c. cheese, stir until melted, then add in the sour cream, stir well. Season to taste with salt & pepper. (Sometimes I like to add some of the crisped bacon into the soup mixture at this point, but that's optional.)</li><li>To serve, top bowls of soup with crisped bacon and potato skins, additional cheddar, sour cream and sliced scallion.</li></ol>"

        "instructions": "<ol><li>Have all the ingredients ready for assembly. In a large bowl filled with water, dip a wrapper in the water. The rice wrapper will begin to soften and this is your cue to remove it from the water and lay it flat. Place 2 shrimp halves in a row across the center and top with basil, mint, cilantro and lettuce. Leave about 1 to 2 inches uncovered on each side.  Fold uncovered sides inward, then tightly roll the wrapper, beginning at the end with the lettuce.  Repeat with remaining wrappers and ingredients. Cut and serve at room temperature with dipping sauce.</li><li>The Culinary Chases Note: The rice wrapper can be fussy to handle if you let it soak too long. I usually give it a couple of swishes in the water and then remove. It may feel slightly stiff but by the time you are ready to roll up, the wrapper will become very pliable.  A typical spring roll contains cooked rice vermicelli, slivers of cooked pork and julienned carrots but you can use whatever suits your fancy.  Enjoy!</li></ol>"

Fold in half of the whipped cream and pour into your prepared crust.</li><li>Top pie with the remaining whipped cream, drizzle with caramel sauce and sprinkle the pecans on top.</li><li>Refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or overnight) before serving.</li><li>* You can also try make this in a springform pan, but I would recommend popping the cake in the freezer before unmolding/serving -- just be sure not to let it warm up too much or it might start to collapse!</li></ol>"

Add the pecans and process until they are ground up into a coarse meal as well.</li><li>Drain the dates and use your hand to squeeze out excess water. Add the drained dates, cocoa powder, vanilla extract, agave nectar, and salt to the food processor. Process until a smooth paste forms.</li><li>Use a tablespoon measure to help you form the truffles. Pack a heaping tablespoon of the mixture into the tablespoon measure  really pack it in there. Use your fingers to slide the half-rounded ball out of the tablespoon measure, and then use your hands to form a tightly packed ball of truffle goodness. Be gentle with them  I found that they fall apart if you try to roll them into balls. It is best to squish them with your hand into perfect little spheres.</li><li>Form truffles until you use up all the mixture. The last bit that was not enough for a truffle went straight into my mouth. :)</li><li>If you choose to, gently roll the truffles in the toppings of your choice. I had some turtle crunch sprinkles, unsweetened coconut flakes, and extra cocoa powder. The cocoa powder definitely gives the the truffles an extra dark chocolate kick, so if you dont like the bitterness of the cocoa powder then dont use that as a topping.</li></ol>"

Cut tofu into 1 inch cubes. Brush them lightly with vegetable oil (I always use olive oil, but I am certain that this recipe would be best with a peanut oil). Place them on a baking sheet and bake for 35 minutes, turning once.</li><li>In a small pan, heat butter and garlic on low until the butter has just almost melted. Add the apples, tofu, and salt. Bring heat up to medium, and cook for about 4 minutes. At this point you should add the water and stir every minute for the next 6-7 additional minutes, or until there is little moisture left in the pan. Turn off the heat, and add the brown sugar. Stir to incorporate all of the sugar. Place on top of salad lettuce.</li></ol>"

You will grill your chicken 8  10 minutes on each side.While your chicken is grilling, go ahead and get your additional ingredients ready to place on the chicken. Place your Balsamic vinegar in a small pan to also go on the grill.Open the grill after chicken has cooked and place the mozzarella slice, basil leaf, and then tomato slice on each chicken breast. Place the pan with Balsamic vinegar on the grill to the side to heat up as well. After 2 minutes, drizzle the bubbling vinegar over the chicken breasts and then cook for an additional 2 minutes.Remove the chicken breasts from the grill and serve warm with a side of potatoes and a salad."

Lay ribs flat in a glass or ceramic dish and pour marinade over them. Allow to marinate at least 4 hours; better still, refrigerate overnight for maximum flavor. Bring to room temperature before grilling.</li><li>Remove ribs from marinade. Scrape marinade from ribs with a rubber spatula and reserve. Grill ribs over a slow fire for about 40 minutes, turning frequently; fire should not flare up and burn them.</li><li>Place reserved marinade in a saucepan and add sugar and honey. Heat only until the sugar is dissolved. Brush on ribs and continue grilling about 20 minutes more, basting as often as necessary to keep ribs moist.</li><li>Slice ribs just before serving. To serve, put 2 to 3 tablespoons of sauce on a plate and lay 2 or 3 ribs on top.</li><li>NOTES : Jack Burson, a friend from Birmingham, Alabama, has told me that his hometown offers some of the best barbecue he has eaten. Now that he's a neighbor in New York, we cook together frequently. Here is our version of one of the best-ever barbecue sauces.</li></ol>"

Add the rice and coconut and saute about 3 minutes, until rice starts to become translucent at the edges. Add the water, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and cover. Cook about 15 minutes, until the water is absorbed and rice is tender. Remove pan from heat and let sit, covered for 10 minutes. Gently fluff the rice with a fork. Add the cilantro and lime juice and pepper to taste.</li><li>Make the fish: Meanwhile, pat the fish fillets dry and season with salt and pepper. In one dish place the flour, in another dish, beat the eggs and 1 T. water until mixed, and in another mix together the coconut and panko. Working with one fillet at a time, dredge fish in the flour, then pat off the excess, dip in the egg, letting any excess drip back into the bowl, then coat in the coconut-panko mix, pressing the coating onto the fish to be sure it adheres.</li><li>Heat the oven to 200 degrees f. (to keep the fish warm between batches). Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until the oil shimmers and just starts to near the smoking point. Add 2 of the fillets and cook about 3 minutes per side, until the fish is golden and cooked through. Drain briefly on paper towels and place in the warm oven while cooking the remaining fish. Serve the fish and rice with the mango salsa and lime wedges.</li></ol>"

I like leaving a bit of stem with the leaves to give better structure to the wraps.</li><li>Chop the cauliflower into small pieces and pulse them in a food processor until it looks like rice. I usually pulse the cauliflower florets and the stalk together.</li><li>Place the olive oil in a saut pan over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the garlic and let it fry for about a minute or two, or until the garlic starts to brown. Add the pulsed cauliflower rice and cook it for about 2-3 minutes. The cauliflower should turn into a vibrant yellow-orange color when it is cooked. Add a pinch of salt and chopped basil to the cauliflower and stir.</li><li>Spiralize the zucchini with Blade B to create zucchini noodles. If you do not have a spiralizer, just create zucchini ribbons with a vegetable peeler.</li><li>To assemble the wraps, place a large leaf flat down. Add a bit of sauted cauliflower, zucchini noodles, red pepper, and avocado along the swiss chard stalk. Drizzle a bit of vinaigrette on top of the vegetables and wrap everything up.</li><li>Enjoy these wraps as a side to your favorite protein! Feel free to dip these wraps in more sauce.</li><li>These wraps are best consumed when they are freshly made. Refrigerate any leftovers in an airtight container.</li></ol>"

Drain, reserving the cooking liquid, and rinse the pasta in cold water. Set aside.Heat the oil over medium heat in a medium or large saucepan. When hot, add the onion to the pot and saut for 5 minutes or until softened. Add the carrot and saut for another few minutes. Now add the garlic and chilies, and continue to saut for another minute.Add the cumin, coriander, turmeric and amchoor powder if using, stir for another minute, and then add the tomato. Simmer for a few minutes and then add the herbs and 1 1/4 cups of the reserved pasta cooking liquid. Simmer for another few minutes and then add the peas. Simmer for another 3 to 4 minutes, and then add the chickpeas and pasta. Simmer for another 5 to 7 minutes, adding more water if necessary to achieve desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper and serve with crusty bread or just as is. It's wonderful served at room temperature or slightly warmed. I sprinkled the bowl with some nutritional yeast, but feel free to sprinkle some fresh grated Parmesan overtop if you enjoy cheese."

Please note the plantain mix will still be moist so use a spoon to help form the balls if you are having difficulty with that. Make sure to drizzle oil on the baking sheet so it does not stick to the sheet when it begins to caramelize. If you do not have an oven you can choose to fry the plantain balls as well. I have not tried the frying method but make sure to dab off the excess oil from the plantain.In a separate pot, on very low heat, melt the butter and pour in the sugar, vanilla, milk and water and stir. Leave it on very low heat throughout. Stir once in a while and if you have a candy thermometer, it is ready at 240F. If you do not, the toffee base is ready when it turns light brown like a caramel colour.Dip the plantain balls and swirl and place on a plate to cool. While its still warm, sprinkle your toppings on it. In this case, my toppings were coconut flakes. Serve when it’s cool."

Remove the tart shells from the oven and set aside to cool.</li><li>If you are not using spring form pans, carefully remove the crusts from the pans at this stage and follow the recipe as follows.</li><li>The tart crusts can be stored in airtight plastic containers, in a single layer, for up to 24 hours.</li><li>Prepare the lime curd: Put the lime juice, sugar, eggs, and yolks in a stainless steel bowl and whisk well.</li><li>Fill a saucepan halfway with water, and bring the water to a boil over high heat, then lower the heat so the water is simmering. Set the bowl over the pot and whisk the lime mixture occasionally until it thickens, approximately 10 minutes. Then whisk in the butter, 1 piece at a time. When all of the butter is melted and incorporated, stir in the lime zest and remove the saucepan from the heat.</li><li>Remove the bowl from the saucepan and let it cool for 5 minutes.</li><li>Transfer the mixture to a blender or food processor, and blend until very smooth. You can also use an immersion/hand blender instead, if you have one.</li><li>The mixture can be made, cooled, covered, and refrigerated for up to 1 week.</li><li>Divide the mixture among the tart shells, leaving about half of space on the top for the chocolate ganache layer. Chill in the refrigerator while making the chocolate ganache, or until set.</li><li>Prepare the chocolate ganache: Over a double boiler (simmer water over low heat in a saucepan and put a heat-resistant bowl on top), melt the chocolate together with the sugar and butter. Stir constantly until the sugar is well incorporated and the mixture is smooth and shiny.</li><li>Remove the melted chocolate from the heat and let it cool for 5 minutes.</li><li>Carefully, pour the liquid chocolate ganache over each tartlet, making sure that the chocolate does not over-flow the graham crust sides. Return the tarts to the refrigerator and chill for 1 to 2 hours, or until the ganache has set. (The ganache on top should take on a smooth matte finish.)</li><li>Prepare the meringue and finish the tarts: In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a whip attachment, whip the reserved egg whites until frothy. Slowly add the sugar, then the cream of tartar, continuing to whip until well incorporated. Increase the stand mixer to medium speed and whip until the whites are shiny and form a stiff peak. Do not over-whip or they will become grainy.</li><li>Transfer the meringue into a pastry bag fitted with a star tip, and pipe it around the edge of each tart. Or, transfer it into a large freezer bag, seal tightly, and snip off one corner. Pipe the meringue on as desired.</li><li>Using a brulee torch, quickly brown the meringue, being careful not to melt the chocolate ganache on top. (Due to the chocolate ganache layer, the meringues should not be browned under a broiler.)</li></ol>"

Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li><li>Sift the dry ingredients into a large bowl, pouring back into the bowl any bits of grain or other ingredients that may remain in the sifter.</li><li>Add the butter and the sugars. Beat with a standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. With the mixer on low-speed, mix just until the butter and sugars are blended, about 2 minutes. Use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl.</li><li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing until each is combined.</li><li>Mix in the vanilla.</li><li>Add the flour mixture to the bowl and blend on low-speed until the flour is barely combined, about 30 seconds, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl</li><li>Add the chocolate all at once and mix on low-speed until the chocolate is evenly combined. Use a spatula to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl, then scrape the batter out onto a work surface, and use your hands to fully incorporate all the ingredients.</li><li>Scoop mounds of dough about 3 tablespoons in size onto the baking sheet, leaving 3 inches between them, or about 6 to a sheet.</li><li>Bake the cookies for 16 to 20 minutes, rotating the sheets halfway through, until the cookies are evenly brown.</li><li>Transfer the cookies, still on the parchment, to the counter to cool. Give them a quick sprinkling with a pinch of sea salt.</li><li>Repeat with the remaining dough.</li><li>These cookies are best eaten warm from the oven or later that same day. They also keep beautifully in the freezer, either by freezing the dough or freezing the cookies once they're cooled. 20-30 seconds in the microwave is all you need to warm one up!</li></ol>"

        "instructions": "<ol><li>Chop your onions, slice your carrots and smash your garlic. Set aside.</li><li>Peel and chop the potatoes. Set aside in a bowl of cold water.</li><li>Remove the casing from your chorizo. This is an important step. Chorizo casing is tough and unforgiving and will make the sausage link curl during the cooking process. Just remove it and don't worry about appearance. Cut the links length-wise then chop into half-moons. Sautee in a separate pan until the are nice and browned. Don't put into the pot until the last minute, otherwise the color of the chorizo will leach into the soup turning it a weird red color.</li><li>Now it's time to prepare the kale. With each individual leaf, cut out the stem. You can do this several ways. Cut a triangle out of the leaf, or fold over the leaf and cut out the stem that way. Or rip off the halves of the leaves off the stem. I like a little bit of stem to give some crunch and texture.</li><li>Tightly roll the leaf into a bundle.</li><li>Run your knife over it to julienne the leaf into thin strips.</li><li>Don't worry if it's not perfect. Set aside the kale.</li><li>In a big pot, sautee your onions, carrots and garlic in a bit of olive oil.</li><li>Once the vegetables start to soften, add the potatoes and some crushed red pepper flakes. Stir the pot and cook the potatoes until the outer edges start turning clear.</li><li>Then add the 6 cups of water and 2 bouillion packets (or 4 cups of broth and 2 cups of water) to the pot. Bring to a boil then let simmer until the potatoes are cooked.</li><li>With a wooden spoon, mash the potatoes against the side of the pot. Do this until almost all the chunks of potatoes are mashed. Leave some chunks behind. This will give your soup a wonderful hearty texture.</li><li>Now it's time to add the Kale. It looks like a lot and will fill up your whole pot but not to worry because it wilts down pretty quickly.</li><li>Cook for 5 minutes at a simmer then stir in chorizo sausage. Serve hot or at room temperature (the latter is my favorite). Eat with a nice crusty loaf of Portuguese bread. Enjoy!</li></ol>"

Add eggs and vanilla.</li><li>Pour into chocolate and mix well.</li><li>Sift together flour, baking soda and salt. Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients alternately with buttermilk.</li><li>Stir coffee into boiling water until combined, then pour into cake batter and stir until smooth.</li><li>Spray two 9-inch cake pans with floured baking spray. Dust with cocoa. Evenly spread cake batter between both pans.  Bang lightly on the counter to settle batter.</li><li>Bake for 30 minutes, or until tester comes out clean, in a preheated oven at 350 degrees. Let cakes cool on a rack for at least an hour.</li><li>As cakes cool, move on to hazelnut pastry cream. Pour whipping cream in a sauce pan and scald (heat just before boiling).</li><li>In a separate bowl, whisk egg yolks with sugar. Add flour and cornstarch. Whisk until smooth.</li><li>Use a ladle to scoop about a cup of the hot cream into the eggy sugar. Whisk immediately and quickly to combine.</li><li>Pour remaining cream in with eggs and keep stirring. Return warm mixture to sauce pan.</li><li>Continue to cook, whisking all the while, until thick.</li><li>Pour into a heat safe bowl and whisk in vanilla and Frangelico until smooth and creamy. Cover with plastic wrap directly touching the cream so a film will not form. Let the cream sit until its reached room temperature. Cool completely in fridge.*  Stir hazelnuts into cream once cold.</li><li>Level off both cooled cakes and slice each one in half, so there are four layers.</li><li>Lay down one cake layer and smooth about a third of the hazelnut cream on top, spreading to about 1/2 inch from edge. Repeat with next two layers and top with last layer.  Place cake in fridge to set while you make the frosting.</li><li>For the frosting, whisk all of the ingredients in a medium sized heat resistant bowl. Place bowl on top of a slightly larger pot with 1-2 inches of hot, simmering water.

        "instructions": "<ol><li>Season your thawed chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Add a little bit of olive oil to your frying pan, add chicken, and cook through. Remove chicken from pan, then add diced onions to the pan. Turn heat to medium and let onions saute through. (You may need to add a little bit more oil to the pan.)</li><li>Meanwhile, chop up your chicken (or shred) very finely. When the onions are soft and translucent, add chicken back to the pan. Season your onions and chicken with garlic, cumin, and chili powder. Finely chop up your jalapeno and add that and your green chilis to your chicken mixture. Stir in your cheese. Now you are ready to assemble.</li><li>Heat up your olive oil in a small frying pan. Add your corn tortilla for about 20 seconds, flipping if the oil doesn't reach the top side. Doing this softens your tortilla so it won't break as you roll it. Do this with all your tortillas and drain on paper towels.</li><li>Take 2 cookie sheets and spray with cooking spray. Lay out a tortilla and add about 2 TBSP of chicken mixture to the middle of your tortilla. Roll up. Fill the remaining tortillas in the same way and line them up next to each other on your cookie sheet, so they are very close to each other, but not touching. This should make two rows on each of your cookie sheets.</li><li>If two pans are too much for your family, then at this point, take one pan and put it in your freezer. Once the enchiladas are frozen, remove them from the pan and stack them in a double lined ziploc freezer bag. When you want to make them, simply line them up again on a greased cookie sheet, let thaw for about an hour on the counter, then bake as instructed.)</li><li>Now, bake your enchiladas in the oven, at 400 degrees, for about 20 minutes. They should be lightly browned. Remove them from the oven and spoon over about 2TBSP of your enchilada sauce over the top of each enchilada. Then sprinkle the tops with cheese. Put the enchiladas back in the oven for about 7 minutes. After that, it's time to eat!</li></ol>"

Press mixture firmly into the bottom of two 6 Springform pans coated with cooking spray. Bake for 15 minutes; cool on a wire rack.</li><li>3. To prepare the filling, using an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Add the sugar then the salt. Beat in the eggs, 1 at a time. Next add the sour cream, lemon juice and zest. Beat until thoroughly mixed. (Make sure you get the cream cheese mixed in from the bottom of the mixing bowl.)</li><li>4. Pour the filling into the two Springform pans. Do not fill to the very top as the mixture expands a little bit. If you have a small amount of mixture left over just bake it in a small baking dish.</li><li>5. Fill an 11x13 (approx.) with water on a lower rack in the oven. On the middle rack, above the water pan, place the two Springform pans. Place in 300* oven for 1 hour and 10 minutes. After 35 minutes, reverse the position of the two pans if they are in two different areas of the oven, such as one in front of the other.</li><li>6. Turn the oven off and leave the cheesecakes in the oven for another hour.  Remove from oven and cool to room temperature on a wire rack.</li><li>7. When cheesecakes are at room temperature, place them in the refrigerator for 8 hours or overnight.</li><li>8. Before removing from pan, use a knife to cut around the pan sides. Then open the clasp on the Springform and release the cheesecake. Place it on a serving plate with the bottom of the Springform pan underneath.</li></ol>"
