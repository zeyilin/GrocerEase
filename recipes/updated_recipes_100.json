The smaller the balls the better as the chicken would cook through better.In a deep fryer or a huge pot of oil on medium heat, allow to heat but not be extra hot and dunk your popcorn chicken to fry till brown.Serve hot.",

Pour 1/3 of the egg mixture into the Nutella and fold in until no egg remains, do this step two more times until all of the egg is well incorporated into the Nutella. Divide the batter between the 4 ramekins dishes then place onto a baking sheet for easy transport in and out of the oven. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Garnish with some chocolate shavings, whipped topping or a few sliced berries, these little cakes can be served warm, room temp or cold.</li></ol>",

        "instructions": "<ol><li>Measure flour mix, using a large spoon to scoop flour into the measuring cup, then level it off with the back of a knife. Whisk with the xanthan gum, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk well, breaking up any lumps of cocoa powder. Set aside.</li><li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat shortening and granulated sugar on medium speed, about 2 minutes till fluffy.  Add vanilla extract, applesauce, and egg replacer, and mix till combined, about 30 seconds.</li><li>Add dry ingredients to stand mixer, in two batches, mixing on medium-low speed, until fully combined, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary.</li><li>Using a rubber spatula, transfer cookie dough to a sheet of parchment paper. Mold into a ball. Cut in half, and transfer one half to a second sheet of parchment. Cover both with a top sheet of parchment paper, and use the palm of your hand to press dough down into disks.  Roll out dough to 1/8th-inch thick.  I like to use my trusty rolling pin rings to do this. Transfer rolled out dough to a cutting board, or trays, and chill in fridge at least 2 hours until firm.</li><li>Preheat oven to 325F. Remove one sheet of dough from fridge, and peel off top sheet of parchment. Using a 1 -inch biscuit cutter cut out cookies.  Transfer to parchment lined baking tray, spacing cookies about 1-inch apart. You may want to use a frosting spatula to transfer the cookies. You should be able to fit about 24 cookies per baking tray.</li><li>Bake in center of the oven 10 minutes, till set. Transfer tray to cooling rack, and let cool on tray 5 minutes, before transferring cookies to cooling rack to cool to room temperature.  Repeat with remaining dough, gathering up scraps and re-rolling until youve used it all. I sometimes roll it out and stick it in the freezer for a few minutes to get it to firm up again.</li><li>Once cookies have cooled to room temperature, dump them all into a freezer safe container, and stick them in the freezer, uncovered for about 30 minutes to chill. This will simplify the coating process.</li><li>Combine chocolate chips and shortening in a microwave safe bowl, and melt in microwave, stopping to stir about every 30 seconds, for a total of about 2 minutes.  Do not overcook, as chocolate burns easily. Remove from microwave, and stir till smooth. Add peppermint extract, and mix in well.</li><li>Remove a handful of the chocolate wafers from the freezer.  You will be making these cookies one at a time. Drop one cookie into the melted chocolate mixture. Use a fork to flip it once, so both sides are now coated. Use the fork to lift the cookie out of the chocolate mixture, and run the bottom of the fork along the edge of the bowl, wiping off the extra drips of chocolate. Set coated cookie down on parchment lined baking tray.  Repeat, until youve coated all the cookies.  You can let them set at room temperature, but I speed up the process by sticking them in the fridge for about 30 minutes, till set.  Once the cookies have set, store them in an airtight container, between layers of parchment or wax paper. Keep them in the fridge, or, for longer-term storage, keep them in the freez</li></ol>",

Use a food processor to chop them to the finest size possible. (A 2-pound bag of almonds is what you'll need for this recipe).</li><li>Preheat oven to 300 F. Combine all of the ingredients thoroughly. Form into desired shapes and sizes (we usually form them into crescents) and bake on greased and floured cookie sheets. Bake for 20-30 minutes depending on thickness of cookie. (In my oven, it takes about 24 minutes).</li><li>NOTES :This recipe is a double recipe. These are one of my favorite cookies-I just LOVE almonds!</li></ol>",

Near the end of the freezing time, you may want to shape it into balls with an ice cream scoop or large spoon.*When the mixture is frozen, it is ready to eat. You may want to let it thaw for a few minutes before serving, depending on how cold your freezer is and how solid the sorbet is.*Note: I let the sorbet freeze overnight and then let it thaw for a few minutes until I could scoop it out of the container to serve.",

Add the tomatoes and stir fry and allow the chicken and tomatoes to cook properly. Stir fry often to make sure it isn\u2019t burning while maintaining the low-medium heat. Once the chicken is cooked inside (check by cutting a piece and making sure it isn\u2019t pink inside), stir in the other vegetables and mango and additional seasoning cubes if needed. Serve with the cous cous.</p>",

        "instructions": "<ol><li>In a bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter until light and fluffy.</li><li>In a separate small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, ground ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and salt. Set aside.</li><li>Add the sugar to the butter and beat until light and fluffy. Turn the mixer to low and mix in the molasses, egg and balsamic vinegar. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the bowl and continue mixing until thoroughly combined.</li><li>Cover and chill about 2 hours or until the dough is easy to handle.</li><li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees.</li><li>Divide the dough in half and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll each half of the dough to 1/4\" thickness adding flour as needed, the dough is very sticky so use flour liberally to prevent your cutouts from sticking to the surface.</li><li>Using cookie cutters, cut dough into shapes and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment approximately 1\" apart.</li><li>Bake in a 400 degree oven for 5-6 minutes. Cool on baking sheets for one minute and move to a wire rack.</li><li>In a small bowl, combine the powdered sugar, vanilla and milk. Whisk to combine. Spoon mixture into a pastry bag or zip top bag and snip off the tip. Add two small dots of icing where the eyes should be and then press one eye on each dot. Decorate the mummies using a zig-zag pattern across the surface of the cookie and allow to dry for 2-4 hours or overnight.</li><li>Store in an airtight container.</li></ol>",

This will hold the dumplings once they are made.</li><li>Dust the table generously with flour. Carefully separate the sheets of dumpling wrappers and lay them on the table. Fill each wrapper with about 1.5 teaspoons of the prepared pork filling.</li><li>Prepare a bowl of water. Dip finger into the water and lightly wet the rim of each dumpling wrapper.</li><li>Bring the dumpling wrapper together till the opposite ends meet. Gently push the filling into the wrapper and pinch the top tip of the dumpling wrapper to seal it.</li><li>From the centre of the dumpling, fold a pleat on ONE side and bring it to the other side of the dumpling. Fold towards the centre of the dumpling. Pinch to seal it.</li><li>Repeat and create a 2nd pleat. Be mindful to pinch tight to seal the dumpling well. Repeat and create a 3rd pleat. Each side should have 3 pleats.</li><li>Repeat the same pleating on the other end of the dumpling. Always ensure that the pleats face the centre of the dumpling.</li><li>Place all prepared dumplings in a well floured dish ensuring that they do not touch each other. Set aside till ready to cook. They can also be frozen at this stage.</li><li>To cook the potstickers, add 2 to 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil to a very hot frying pan. The potstickers should be cooked in at least 2 batches.</li><li>When the oil is hot, add the dumplings ensuring that the flat surfaces face down. Pan fry till the bottoms of the dumplings are a nice golden brown.</li><li>Add 1/3 cup of water to the pan. Cover the pan immediately and let the steam cook the dumplings for 4 to 5 minutes.</li><li>Once the water has evaporated, remove the cover and let the dumplings sit in the hot pan for another minute for its base to crisp up again. These are now Chinese potstickers.</li><li>Gently transfer the potstickers to a plate. Serve immediately.</li><li>These Chinese potstickers are best served with a vinegar dip made with balsamic or black chinese vinegar and thinly sliced ginger. Soy sauce, chili oil or sesame oil may also be added to the dipping sauce.</li></ol>",

        "instructions": "<ol><li>Heat the oil in a deep-fryer or dutch oven to 365 degrees F.</li><li>Separate the onion slices into rings, and set aside. In a small bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and salt.</li><li>Dip the onion slices into the flour mixture until they are all coated; set aside. This will help the batter adhere.</li><li>Gently beat the egg and buttermilk into the flour mixture using hand mixer.</li><li>Dip the floured rings into the batter to coat, then place on a wire rack to drain until the batter stops dripping. The wire rack may be placed over a sheet of aluminum foil for easier clean up.</li><li>Place the bread and panko crumbs out on a plate or shallow dish. Place rings one at a time into the crumbs, and scoop the crumbs up over the ring to coat.</li><li>Give it a gentle tap as you remove it from the crumbs. The coating should cling very well. Repeat with remaining rings.I suggest completing this entire step before starting to fry rings. Its very easy to burn them if youre distracted. I may or may not be speaking from experience.</li><li>Deep fry the rings a few at a time for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. They should float to the top immediately  if they dont your oil is not hot enough. Turn rings over once during the frying time.</li><li>Remove form oil and transfer to a paper towel to drain. Season with seasoning salt, and serve warm.</li><li>Preparing Dipping Sauce: Mix Sriracha Chili and Crema thoroughly until completely blended. Use more or less of the chili sauce depending on your heat preference.</li></ol>",

        "instructions": "<ol><li>To make the espresso bring water to a boil and then pour it over the espresso. Set aside to cool. When cooled add the melted ice cream</li><li>For the caramel-cream: Place 1 cup sugar and water in a 2 quart pot with a glass lid. Cover and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Do not remove lid or stir the sugar mixture or it will begin to crystallize. The glass lid is a convenient way of watching the sugar so you know when it changes color as well as keeping the steam inside and preventing crystallization.</li><li>When the sugar begins to look caramelized watch it carefully and remove from heat when it reaches deep amber color. Be very careful as the sugar is extremely hot and also watch that it doesn't burn. It can go from amber to burnt very quickly.</li><li>Immediately off the heat pour the one cup cream into the caramel. The caramel will stiffen, sizzle and splatter so be careful. Return to a medium heat and cook until the caramel melts together with the cream.</li><li>Pour the caramel cream into the coffee and refrigerate until cold.</li><li>To assemble, fill a glass with ice, scoop two ice cream scoops into each glass.</li><li>Pour the iced espresso cream over and top with sweetened whipped cream (the other cup of cream whipped with 1 tablespoon sugar).</li><li>Garnish with caramel syrup and serve chilled.</li></ol>",

        "instructions": "<ol><li>In a large bowl, add mustard, bread crumbs, egg, garlic powder, salt and pepper to ground elk meat. Mix all ingredients by hand and then form into small patties. Use a  cup measuring cup to size how much meat to use when forming your patties.  Place meat on tinfoil and press gently with your thumb creating a small indent in the center. This will help keep patties from shrinking when cooking.</li><li>Pre-heat the barbecue to high temperature.</li><li>I recommend leaving the elk burgers on the tinfoil while cooking on the BBQ. The elk meat is very lean and can have the tendency to dry out if overcooked. Cooking on tinfoil reduces the risk of overcooking.</li><li>Cook 7 minutes or until brown and then flip patties. Continue cooking on other side until brown  7 minutes. Add smoked mozzarella cheese to the top of burgers during the last 2 minutes of cooking. Close lid and melt cheese.</li><li>While cooking your burgers, place pancetta bacon slices on tinfoil and place on the barbeque for the last few minutes of cooking. Toast buns on grill.</li><li>Place elk sliders on Hawaiian Sweet Rolls, top with a slice of pancetta bacon and a few cherry tomatoes and you are set! Enjoy!</li></ol>",

The water should be hot to the touch but not hot enough to burn you.</li><li>Process the almonds in a food processor until coarse almond meal is formed. Add the pecans and process until they are ground up into a coarse meal as well.</li><li>Drain the dates and use your hand to squeeze out excess water. Add the drained dates, cocoa powder, vanilla extract, agave nectar, and salt to the food processor. Process until a smooth paste forms.</li><li>Use a tablespoon measure to help you form the truffles. Pack a heaping tablespoon of the mixture into the tablespoon measure  really pack it in there. Use your fingers to slide the half-rounded ball out of the tablespoon measure, and then use your hands to form a tightly packed ball of truffle goodness. Be gentle with them  I found that they fall apart if you try to roll them into balls. It is best to squish them with your hand into perfect little spheres.</li><li>Form truffles until you use up all the mixture. The last bit that was not enough for a truffle went straight into my mouth. :)</li><li>If you choose to, gently roll the truffles in the toppings of your choice. I had some turtle crunch sprinkles, unsweetened coconut flakes, and extra cocoa powder. The cocoa powder definitely gives the the truffles an extra dark chocolate kick, so if you dont like the bitterness of the cocoa powder then dont use that as a topping.</li></ol>",

Let stand while grinding the walnuts. </li><li>Whisk together with the baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.</li><li>Pour half the batter into prepared pan. Using a spoon, dollop lines of jam across the batter and swirl into batter using a knife. Pour the rest of the batter on top.</li><li>Mix up the crumble topping: add the walnuts to a bag and crush until broken down into pea-sized crumbs. Toss with the oat flour, cinnamon, sugar and rolled oats if using. Stir in the tablespoon of oil until the everything starts to come together--mixture should be crumbly. Sprinkle the topping evenly across the top of the batter and bake for 25 minutes, or until browned on top and it springs back slightly when touched. Serve warm.</li></ol>",

        "instructions": "<ol><li>In a pan, saut garlic in olive oil until light brown.</li><li>Add onions. Saute until almost translucent.</li><li>Add the ground pork and sprinkle with  tsp salt and  tsp blackpepper. Stir-fry until no more pink color is showing.</li><li>Add carrots, oyster sauce and fish sauce.  Mix well.</li><li>Add shrimps and cook until pink then add egg. Mix well and remove from heat. Allow to completely cool down. Drain if necessary. Set aside the sauce.</li><li>The lumpia wrappers are very tightly packed, so be careful when pulling them apart. If you cannot find lumpia wrappers, you can use spring roll wrappers.</li><li>Spoon 1 Tbsp mixture on the lower edge of the wrapper leaving 1 inch edge. Begin to fold egg roll like an envelope: first, fold over the lower 1 inch edge over the filing, then the left edge, then the right edge, then roll up to the top edge. To seal the wrapper just moisten the top edge with water. I used the sauce I got from draining the cooked mixture.</li><li>Heat vegetable oil in a large, deep frying pan over medium high heat. Place egg roll one at a time into hot oil, with the seam down (this will keep it from unraveling) and then quickly turn the egg roll to ensure the skin crisp up and does not stick to other egg rolls in the pan. Adjust heat so that the oil is bubbling gently and not too vigorously around the egg rolls. Each egg roll will take about 5 minutes to cook. Shake the egg roll over the pan to help remove the excess oil. Place egg roll on layers of paper towels to drain.</li><li>Serve the lumpia or Filipino egg rolls with your favorite sweet and sour sauce or a spicy vinegar sauce.</li><li>Nutritional information is for 1 egg roll.</li></ol>",

Saute until almost translucent.</li><li>Add the ground pork and sprinkle with  tsp salt and  tsp blackpepper. Stir-fry until no more pink color is showing.</li><li>Add carrots, oyster sauce and fish sauce.  Mix well.</li><li>Add shrimps and cook until pink then add egg. Mix well and remove from heat. Allow to completely cool down. Drain if necessary. Set aside the sauce.</li><li>The lumpia wrappers are very tightly packed, so be careful when pulling them apart. If you cannot find lumpia wrappers, you can use spring roll wrappers.</li><li>Spoon 1 Tbsp mixture on the lower edge of the wrapper leaving 1 inch edge. Begin to fold egg roll like an envelope: first, fold over the lower 1 inch edge over the filing, then the left edge, then the right edge, then roll up to the top edge. To seal the wrapper just moisten the top edge with water. I used the sauce I got from draining the cooked mixture.</li><li>Heat vegetable oil in a large, deep frying pan over medium high heat. Place egg roll one at a time into hot oil, with the seam down (this will keep it from unraveling) and then quickly turn the egg roll to ensure the skin crisp up and does not stick to other egg rolls in the pan. Adjust heat so that the oil is bubbling gently and not too vigorously around the egg rolls. Each egg roll will take about 5 minutes to cook. Shake the egg roll over the pan to help remove the excess oil. Place egg roll on layers of paper towels to drain.</li><li>Serve the lumpia or Filipino egg rolls with your favorite sweet and sour sauce or a spicy vinegar sauce.</li><li>Nutritional information is for 1 egg roll.</li></ol>",

        "instructions": "<ol><li>Season your thawed chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Add a little bit of olive oil to your frying pan, add chicken, and cook through. Remove chicken from pan, then add diced onions to the pan. Turn heat to medium and let onions saute through. (You may need to add a little bit more oil to the pan.)</li><li>Meanwhile, chop up your chicken (or shred) very finely. When the onions are soft and translucent, add chicken back to the pan. Season your onions and chicken with garlic, cumin, and chili powder. Finely chop up your jalapeno and add that and your green chilis to your chicken mixture. Stir in your cheese. Now you are ready to assemble.</li><li>Heat up your olive oil in a small frying pan. Add your corn tortilla for about 20 seconds, flipping if the oil doesn't reach the top side. Doing this softens your tortilla so it won't break as you roll it. Do this with all your tortillas and drain on paper towels.</li><li>Take 2 cookie sheets and spray with cooking spray. Lay out a tortilla and add about 2 TBSP of chicken mixture to the middle of your tortilla. Roll up. Fill the remaining tortillas in the same way and line them up next to each other on your cookie sheet, so they are very close to each other, but not touching. This should make two rows on each of your cookie sheets.</li><li>If two pans are too much for your family, then at this point, take one pan and put it in your freezer. Once the enchiladas are frozen, remove them from the pan and stack them in a double lined ziploc freezer bag. When you want to make them, simply line them up again on a greased cookie sheet, let thaw for about an hour on the counter, then bake as instructed.)</li><li>Now, bake your enchiladas in the oven, at 400 degrees, for about 20 minutes. They should be lightly browned. Remove them from the oven and spoon over about 2TBSP of your enchilada sauce over the top of each enchilada. Then sprinkle the tops with cheese. Put the enchiladas back in the oven for about 7 minutes. After that, it's time to eat!</li></ol>",

Do not remove lid or stir the sugar mixture or it will begin to crystallize. The glass lid is a convenient way of watching the sugar so you know when it changes color as well as keeping the steam inside and preventing crystallization.</li><li>When the sugar begins to look caramelized watch it carefully and remove from heat when it reaches deep amber color. Be very careful as the sugar is extremely hot and also watch that it doesn't burn. It can go from amber to burnt very quickly.</li><li>Immediately off the heat pour the one cup cream into the caramel. The caramel will stiffen, sizzle and splatter so be careful. Return to a medium heat and cook until the caramel melts together with the cream.</li><li>Pour the caramel cream into the coffee and refrigerate until cold.</li><li>To assemble, fill a glass with ice, scoop two ice cream scoops into each glass.</li><li>Pour the iced espresso cream over and top with sweetened whipped cream (the other cup of cream whipped with 1 tablespoon sugar).</li><li>Garnish with caramel syrup and serve chilled.</li></ol>",

        "instructions": "<p>Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F. Poke your sweet potatoes with a fork and place them directly on the rack of your oven. Place a piece of foil on the rack below to reduce mess. Bake the sweet potatoes for 45-50 minutes or until tender. Times may vary depending on how hot your oven gets.Remove the potatoes from the oven and let stand at room temperature until they are cool enough to handle, about 20-30 minutes. Leave the oven on.While your potatoes are cooling, melt the butter over medium heat. Continue to cook the butter, stirring frequently, until brown bits begin to form on the bottom of the pan, about 5-6 minutes. Pay close attention as the butter can quickly go from brown to burnt in a matter of seconds. Once you see the brown bits forming and a nutty aroma fills the air, pull the butter from the heat immediately. Set aside.Cut the tops off of the sweet potatoes, lengthwise. Scoop the sweet potato flesh into a medium bowl, leaving the skins in tact. To the bowl, add the brown butter, 2 tablespoons of the fresh parsley, 3/4 of the chopped bacon, and 4 ounces of the goats cheese. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper to taste and mash the ingredients together until combined. Scoop the filling back into the sweet potatoes.Place the potatoes on a baking sheet that has been lined with foil or parchment paper. Place them back in the oven to bake for 25 minutes.While your potatoes are baking for a second time, prepare your avocado cream. In the bowl of your food processor or blender, combine the avocados, sour cream and buttermilk. Add a dash of salt and pepper and pulse until completely smooth and creamy.Once your potatoes have baked, remove from oven. Sprinkle on the remaining parsley, bacon and goats cheese. Drizzle with avocado cream and serve immediately.Enjoy!I hope you enjoy this recipe for brown butter twice baked sweet potatoes!</p>",
