        "instructions": "Chop off the stems of the swiss chard at the point where it meets the leaf. You could stem the swiss chard entirely. I like leaving a bit of stem with the leaves to give better structure to the wraps.\nChop the cauliflower into small pieces and pulse them in a food processor until it looks like rice. I usually pulse the cauliflower florets and the stalk together.\nPlace the olive oil in a saut pan over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the garlic and let it fry for about a minute or two, or until the garlic starts to brown. Add the pulsed cauliflower rice and cook it for about 2-3 minutes. The cauliflower should turn into a vibrant yellow-orange color when it is cooked. Add a pinch of salt and chopped basil to the cauliflower and stir.\nSpiralize the zucchini with Blade B to create zucchini noodles. If you do not have a spiralizer, just create zucchini ribbons with a vegetable peeler.\nTo assemble the wraps, place a large leaf flat down. Add a bit of sauted cauliflower, zucchini noodles, red pepper, and avocado along the swiss chard stalk. Drizzle a bit of vinaigrette on top of the vegetables and wrap everything up.\nEnjoy these wraps as a side to your favorite protein! Feel free to dip these wraps in more sauce.\nThese wraps are best consumed when they are freshly made. Refrigerate any leftovers in an airtight container.\n",

Transfer the mixture to a container, cover, and transfer to the freezer. Every few hours, check to see how it is setting and mix it around a little. Near the end of the freezing time, you may want to shape it into balls with an ice cream scoop or large spoon.*When the mixture is frozen, it is ready to eat. You may want to let it thaw for a few minutes before serving, depending on how cold your freezer is and how solid the sorbet is.*Note: I let the sorbet freeze overnight and then let it thaw for a few minutes until I could scoop it out of the container to serve.",

You can leave the ribs whole if you like the way they look better--I just think they are easier to handle on the grill in smaller pieces! Pour 4 cups of water and 1 tsp. of liquid smoke in a roasting pan.\nPlace the ribs in the pan, top up. Tightly cover the pan with foil and bake for 2 hours. Remove from the oven and rest until ready to grill. Meanwhile, add 1 Tb. oil to a sauce pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and saut for 1-2 minutes. Then add the rest of the ingredients for the BBQ sauce to the sauce pan. Simmer for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nHeat a grill over medium-low heat. Brush the ribs completely with BBQ sauce. Place them on the grill and cook for 20 minutes, turning and brushing every 5 minutes until the desired bark has developed.\nIt's fun to make your own BBQ sauce. But in a pinch, buy a bottled variety you like and simmer for a few minutes with the coffee granules!\n",

(If using canned chickpeas, rinse thoroughly.)Meanwhile, toast the pine nuts in a dry unoiled skillet or saucepan over medium-low heat, tossing or stirring frequently, for 10 minutes or until lightly browned.Transfer the chickpeas to a food processor and add the pine nuts, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1/4 cup of the reserved chickpea cooking liquid (or water if using canned chicpeas), the tahini, garlic, lemon juice and salt. Process until smooth, adding more of the reserved chickpea cooking liquid or water as necessary to reach a light creamy consistency. Taste for seasoning and add more salt or lemon juice as desired.Transfer the hummus to a shallow bowl and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle with za'atar and paprika, and serve with chopped fresh vegetables or toasted pita triangles.Refrigerate leftover hummus for a few days or freeze for up to a month.",

Cool to room temperature and set aside.\nBeat eggs for 3 minutes in a medium bowl until thick and light yellow; gradually beat in powdered sugar.\nStir in cream, salt and vanilla.\nAdd caramel mixture, gently stir until smooth.\nCover and chill for at least 4 hours or overnight.\nPour the mixture into an ice cream machine and churn until frozen. Transfer to plastic container and place in the freezer for an hour before serving.\nServing: take it out for 5-10 minutes before serving, or longer, so it comes to the right scooping temperature.\nEasy suggestion: ice cream is best served in chilled glass or porcelain bowls. Scoop it with a hot, but dry, ice-cream spoon (soak it in boiling water, then wipe dry).\n",

        "instructions": "Directions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a 9 by 9 or 7 by 11 baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.\nCombine the flax, applesauce and almond milk together in a small bowl. Set aside to allow to thicken. In a food processor, combine the blueberries, pear, black beans and oil. Pulse until the mixture become very smooth. Next, add the extracts and process until fully combined. Remove the contents from processor into a medium sized mixing bowl. Add the coconut sugar, cocoa, baking powder, soda, and salt and mix. Add the flour with the chocolate chips and mix until just combined. Pour the batter into your prepared dish and bake at 350 for 44-45 minutes.\nRemove from the oven and allow to cool for at least 50 minutes. If you would like, place the brownies in the fridge for 20 or 30 minutes to speed up cooling time. While the brownies cool, start on your mint filling.\nIn a small bowl, combine the soft avocado with full fat coconut milk or heavy cream. Beat on high for about 5 minutes until the mixture is fluffy and smooth. Add the powdered xylitol and mix well. Add peppermint extract and coloring if desired, and beat until all incorporated. Once the mixture is perfectly fluffy and creamy, add the flour and mix until just combined. The mixture should be thick and smooth but still easy to spread. Spread the mixture evenly over the cooled brownies and place in the fridge for 10 minutes, until the mint filling has firmed.\nNext, melt the chocolate. Add the oil to the melted chocolate and stir to combine. Remove the brownies from the fridge and pour the melted chocolate over the brownies, gently and quickly spread the chocolate evenly over the brownies. The mint filling should be cold so the warm chocolate doesnt melt the mint filling, but the chocolate will cool quickly once it touches the cold mint. Make sure to work quickly so the chocolate layer will be even. Return the brownies to the fridge to cool for another 5 minutes until the chocolate is set.\nCut the brownies after the 5 minutes with a sharp knife. Serve brownies chilled or at room temperature. Store any left overs in an airtight container in the refrigerator.\nNOTE: Once the chocolate layer has firmed, be sure to cut all the brownies immediately with a sharp knife. I cut some of the brownies when they were really, really cold, and they didnt cut clean and pretty.\n*For those who are not concerned with gluten content, wheat or white flour would work okay as well. For wheat, decrease the amount by 1 tablespoon. For the filling, be sure to use a white color flour to keep the mint filling a bright pretty green color.\n**You can use any kind of chocolate you like, but dark chocolate gives a wonderful flavor to the peppermint and sugar free dark chocolate is the easiest to find.\n",

In a large bowl, cream together butter, sugar and brown sugar until light. Beat in egg, milk and vanilla extract. With the mixer on low speed or by hand, blend in the flour mixture, stirring only until no streaks of flour remain. Stir in chocolate chips.\nDivide dough into two equal parts. Place each on a sheet of wax or parchment paper and shape into a log. Wrap in paper and chill logs for 1-2 hours, until firm.\nMake the filling by combining all ingredients in a medium bowl and mix at medium-high speed until smooth. Set aside.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nRemove dough logs from the fridge. Using a sharp knife, divide each log into eight even slices (total of 16 big slices of cookie dough).\nWorking with one piece of cookie dough at a time, flatten the dough into a 3-4 inch wide dish between your palms. Place about 1 tablespoon cream cheese filling in the center of the dough, then pinch the side of the dough together to seal. Work carefully so all the filling is sealed inside.\nPlace on the baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough.\nBake for 15-18 minutes, until cookies are golden brown around the edges. Cool on the baking sheet for 2-3 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.\nMakes 16 gut busting cookies.\n",

Stir in the salt, chili powder, cayenne, cumin, coriander, ajwain seeds, asafetida, yogurt and fenugreek leaves. Mix in about 1/4 cup of water to make a semi-hard batter. Cover and let stand at room temperature for 1 hour. Dusting your hands with flour, divide the dough into 10 to 12 small balls. Roll out each ball into a roughly 3-inch circle. Brush a non-stick pan with a bit of ghee or oil and heat over medium heat. When hot, add a rolled out portion to the pan and cook for 4 minutes or until the bottom is browned. Sprinkle with a bit of oil, flip and fry for another 2 to 3 minutes or until both sides are browned. Transfer to a plate, keep heated in a 150 oven, and repeat for the rest of the pancakes.",

Set aside.In the bowl of your stand mixer, with paddle attachment fixed (or a handheld electric mixer may be used), combine the cream cheese, blueberry jam, 2 tablespoons of confectioner's sugar, flour, salt and  teaspoon of almond extract. Mix until smooth, about 30 seconds. Set aside.Lay your crescent roll wedges out on a large work surface. Take about a tablespoon of the cream cheese mixture and dollop it on the wide end of each crescent roll. Roll them up until the narrow end is sealed underneath. Transfer them to the prepared baking sheet and brush them with the egg wash. Sprinkle with turbinado sugar.Place the crescent rolls in the oven and bake for 13-15 minutes, or until puffed and golden. Remove from heat and transfer to a wire rack to cool.While the crescent rolls are cooling, prepare your glaze. In a medium bowl, combine the remaining  cup of confectioner's sugar, remaining  teaspoon of almond extract, and milk. Whisk until smooth. Adjust seasoning by adding a pinch of sea salt if you find that the glaze is too sweet. Drizzle the glaze on the slightly cooled crescent rolls and serve immediately. Enjoy!",

Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until soft. Drain, reserving the cooking liquid. (If using canned chickpeas, rinse thoroughly.)Meanwhile, toast the pine nuts in a dry unoiled skillet or saucepan over medium-low heat, tossing or stirring frequently, for 10 minutes or until lightly browned.Transfer the chickpeas to a food processor and add the pine nuts, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1/4 cup of the reserved chickpea cooking liquid (or water if using canned chicpeas), the tahini, garlic, lemon juice and salt. Process until smooth, adding more of the reserved chickpea cooking liquid or water as necessary to reach a light creamy consistency. Taste for seasoning and add more salt or lemon juice as desired.Transfer the hummus to a shallow bowl and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle with za'atar and paprika, and serve with chopped fresh vegetables or toasted pita triangles.Refrigerate leftover hummus for a few days or freeze for up to a month.",

Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 40 to 60 minutes. Take care not to overcook  the beans should be tender but not be falling apart. Drain and set aside.To prepare the eggplant, cut of the stem and bottom edge and then cut in half lengthwise. Score the flesh into diagonal 1-inch lines, then turn and score again until you have a diagonal pattern. Take care not to cut through the skin. Sprinkle with some salt and let sit for 40 minutes. Rinse and squeeze out any excess water. Brush the eggplant with some oil and transfer to a roasting pan. Bake in a preheated 400 oven until the flesh appears collapsed and is wrinkly. Remove from heat and let cool for about 10 minutes, season with a bit of salt, and remove the flesh from the eggplant. If there is too much water, drain in a strainer. Set aside.Heat the oil over medium heat in the same saucepan used to cook the black-eyed peas. When hot, toss in the shallots and chilies and saut for 2 to 3 minutes. Now add the spices and stir for another minute, until fragrant. Add the tomato, cook for another few minutes, and then add the eggplant and black-eyed peas, and cook for another few minutes, stirring often.Pour a few tablespoons of water into the pan and add handfuls of chard at a time until wilted. Add more water as necessary. Add the lemon juice and salt to taste near the end of the cooking time. Remove from heat, cover, and let sit for a few minutes before serving.",

Cook for about 1-2 minutes to get rid of the flour taste.\nAdd the mustard powder, pinch of cayenne, black pepper and stir to combine.\nDrizzle the milk in a steady stream whisking the whole time so that the mixture stays creamy.\nSeason with salt and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly.\nWhen mixture thickens, add the cheese one handful at a time. Taste the sauce and adjust the salt/pepper as needed.\nSpread the cauliflower florets into a 2 quart baking dish (or iron skillet), spoon the sauce over the top and sprinkle about 2 tbs of cheese over the top. Bake until browned and bubbly  about 30 minutes. Garnish with fresh herbs if desired.\n",

        "instructions": "In your soup pot, saute over med-high heat: 2 Tbsp of your olive oil with the shallot, onion and jalapeno. When cooked lightly, add in lemon juice, veggie broth, remaining oil, salt and pepper. Reduce heat to medium. Add Potatoes and bring broth to a boil. Cook until potatoes are tender.\nAdd chopped Broccoli (florets and steams). Remember to leave out a few florets for later use though.Cover with lid, when broccoli is tender, turn heat off.\nTransfer contents of pot into a large mixing bowl. Allow to cool slightly. Add to the bowl the fresh parsley, Chobani and almond milk. Fold new ingredients into the hot soup mixture.\nIn batches, puree the soup in a food-processor (maybe someday soon, a Vitamix!) style blender. Soup should be smooth-no lumps or chunks. In the soup pot, add the broccoli florets, a dash of veggie broth and saute covered for about a minute until tender. Add the pureed soup back into the soup pot. Add a bay leaf and a few pinches of chopped basil (optional). Simmer uncovered for at least twenty minutes to cook out all the air bubbles. Stir constantly for the first few minutes. Remove the bay leaf before serving or storing.\n",

When the mixture is hot, add the asparagus pieces and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring. Add the garlic and cook for about a minute. Spread the asparagus so it is evenly distributed across the bottom of the pan.\nAdd the egg mixture to the pan and allow the eggs to cook without mixing them. Use a rubber spatula to run around the edges of the frittata as it cooks so the edges dont stick and burn. After 1-2 minutes, add the cheese evenly to the egg mixture.\nWhen the outer edges of the frittata have set but the center is still slightly runny, arrange the cherry tomatoes and asparagus spears on the top of the frittata, sprinkle the remaining thyme over the top, then remove the pan from the heat and place it in an oven set to broil.\nThe broiler will allow the top portion of the egg mixture to set and cook thoroughly. Keep a close watch so the frittata doesnt burn.\nAfter a few minutes, when the eggs have set completely and begin to turn golden, carefully remove the pan from the oven.\nUse a rubber spatula to run around the edges and underside of the frittata, and slide it onto a round serving plate.\nSlice and serve warm or at room temperature.\n",

If paste is thin, add extra flour. Mix well till the mixture is smooth. Stir in eggplant &amp; artichoke hearts and mix till they are well coated.\nAdd rosemary, chili flakes, garlic and season to taste with sea salt and pepper (be careful not to add too much salt) . Add goat cheese and mix carefully so not to cream it - you want them to be chunky.\nHeat a large oiled pan. When hot, pour about 2 spoonfuls of mixture into the pan and they should form into galettes or \"cakes\". Cook until both sides are golden brown.\nMakes 6 galettes/cakes.

Roast whole at 400 degrees until softened, but not completely cooked (about 30 minutes). Remove from the oven and carefully peel the beets, then cut in half. You can leave the fingerlings whole, and slice lengthwise in half before serving, or halve them and continue roasting (both ways are delicious!)\nQuarter the fennel and red onion lengthwise, and cut the kabocha into 1/2 inch wedges.\nToss all the vegetables in a bowl and drizzle enough olive oil to sufficiently coat. Then, add a big splash of balsamic vinegar (approx. 1/4 cup), a couple hearty pinches of Kosher salt, a few good turns of fresh ground black pepper, and a small sprig of fresh rosemary. Let roast another 30-40 minutes, turning every so often to get an even roast.\n",

Set aside covered to keep warm.\nPreheat oven to 375.\nSalt and pepper generously the pork chops. In a large skillet over medium high heat add the oil.

Repeat until all slices are grilled.\nFor the meat sauce lightly saute the onions in olive oil until tender.\nAdd ground beef and saute, stirring frequently to break up the clumps of meat, until the meat is no longer pink.\nStir in tomatoes, garlic, cinnamon, allspice, salt and pepper and simmer briefly on low heat.\nAdd in tomato paste and a little water if the sauce is to thick. Remove from heat and set aside.\nFor the bchamel sauce add flour to the melted butter, stirring constantly. When the mixture is evenly thick, gradually whisk in warm milk.  Gently bring to the boil, then remove from heat, season with pepper and nutmeg. Whisk in (vigorously) the egg yolks. Set aside.\nThinly coat with olive oil a suitable ovenproof baking dish, sprinkle the bottom with homemade bread crumbs.\nPlace a layer of egg plant, cover with some meat sauce and feta cheese and repeat this until the pan is almost full. Finish with a layer of feta cheese.\nTop with bchamel sauce.\nCover with tin foil and bake in a preheated oven at 180C for 1 hour.\nRemove moussaka from the oven and let it set at room temperature 45 minutes before serving.\n",

        "instructions": "Measure flour mix, using a large spoon to scoop flour into the measuring cup, then level it off with the back of a knife. Whisk with the xanthan gum, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk well, breaking up any lumps of cocoa powder. Set aside.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat shortening and granulated sugar on medium speed, about 2 minutes till fluffy.  Add vanilla extract, applesauce, and egg replacer, and mix till combined, about 30 seconds.\nAdd dry ingredients to stand mixer, in two batches, mixing on medium-low speed, until fully combined, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary.\nUsing a rubber spatula, transfer cookie dough to a sheet of parchment paper. Mold into a ball. Cut in half, and transfer one half to a second sheet of parchment. Cover both with a top sheet of parchment paper, and use the palm of your hand to press dough down into disks.  Roll out dough to 1/8th-inch thick.  I like to use my trusty rolling pin rings to do this. Transfer rolled out dough to a cutting board, or trays, and chill in fridge at least 2 hours until firm.\nPreheat oven to 325F. Remove one sheet of dough from fridge, and peel off top sheet of parchment. Using a 1 -inch biscuit cutter cut out cookies.  Transfer to parchment lined baking tray, spacing cookies about 1-inch apart. You may want to use a frosting spatula to transfer the cookies. You should be able to fit about 24 cookies per baking tray.\nBake in center of the oven 10 minutes, till set. Transfer tray to cooling rack, and let cool on tray 5 minutes, before transferring cookies to cooling rack to cool to room temperature.  Repeat with remaining dough, gathering up scraps and re-rolling until youve used it all. I sometimes roll it out and stick it in the freezer for a few minutes to get it to firm up again.\nOnce cookies have cooled to room temperature, dump them all into a freezer safe container, and stick them in the freezer, uncovered for about 30 minutes to chill. This will simplify the coating process.\nCombine chocolate chips and shortening in a microwave safe bowl, and melt in microwave, stopping to stir about every 30 seconds, for a total of about 2 minutes.  Do not overcook, as chocolate burns easily. Remove from microwave, and stir till smooth. Add peppermint extract, and mix in well.\nRemove a handful of the chocolate wafers from the freezer.  You will be making these cookies one at a time. Drop one cookie into the melted chocolate mixture. Use a fork to flip it once, so both sides are now coated. Use the fork to lift the cookie out of the chocolate mixture, and run the bottom of the fork along the edge of the bowl, wiping off the extra drips of chocolate. Set coated cookie down on parchment lined baking tray.  Repeat, until youve coated all the cookies.  You can let them set at room temperature, but I speed up the process by sticking them in the fridge for about 30 minutes, till set.  Once the cookies have set, store them in an airtight container, between layers of parchment or wax paper. Keep them in the fridge, or, for longer-term storage, keep them in the freez\n",

Brush them lightly with vegetable oil (I always use olive oil, but I am certain that this recipe would be best with a peanut oil). Place them on a baking sheet and bake for 35 minutes, turning once.\nIn a small pan, heat butter and garlic on low until the butter has just almost melted. Add the apples, tofu, and salt. Bring heat up to medium, and cook for about 4 minutes. At this point you should add the water and stir every minute for the next 6-7 additional minutes, or until there is little moisture left in the pan. Turn off the heat, and add the brown sugar. Stir to incorporate all of the sugar. Place on top of salad lettuce.\n",

Freeze it for 5-10 minutes.\nMix the chocolate shell ingredients together until it looks like chocolate sauce.\nRemove the pumpkin filling and drop -tablespoon dollops of the pie filling into each cup.\nPour about 2 teaspoons of chocolate sauce into each cup so that you could just about cover up the pumpkin filling.\nFreeze the cups for 30 minutes to an hour.\nStore in the refrigerator. The chocolate will turn gooey if you leave the cups out in room temperature for a long time.\nEnjoy!\n",

Batter should be thick, but if you like thinner pancakes, add an additional tablespoon or two of milk. Fold in sliced bananas.\nGrease with a few drops of oil and spread around the pan. Add batter,  cup at a time (batter should sizzle when it hits the pan). Cook for about 2 minutes on each side (the first pancakes will take the longest to cook) and serve warm, with lots of maple syrup, additional bananas, nuts, chocolate chips, etc.\n",

(See note in About section on where to purchase)\nFirst boil your eggs, then slide the egg inside the press and screw the top down so it pushes the egg into the corners.\nLet the egg cool and remove it from the mold. For better results use medium size eggs.\nIf you intend to prepare this for a party, I suggest you buy several cubers, this way you can boil and chill several eggs at a time, or it will take you a lot of time.\nTo prepare hard boiled eggs, place eggs in a saucepan, cover with cold water and bring to a boil over medium heat. As soon as the water comes to a full boil, let the eggs boil for 5 minutes, and then remove from heat and let stand covered in hot water 10 minutes .\nFilling is made with cream cheese, ham and egg yolk, it tastes very soft, it is ideal for kids.\n",

        "instructions": "This crock-pot entre is really, really good. It takes 10 minutes to prepare, is made from ingredients that are readily available and is a bargain when you consider the number of servings it provides.  One caution -  you'll have mush with  Asian flavor if you cook this for more than 5 to 6 hours. The recipe is adapted from \"Slow Cooker Recipes for All Occasions\",  a Rival Crock-Pot publication.  Served with rice and snow peas you have the makings of a minor feast that you'll repeat often. My family loves this dish. I think yours will, too. This, by the way, is a wonderful recipe for novice cooks. If you have a willing teen, let them have a go at it.Asian-Style Country Ribs with Black Bean Garlic SauceIngredients:3 to 4 pounds boneless country-style pork ribs, cross cut in 1-1/2-inch pieces3 tablespoons prepared black bean garlic sauce from a jar (i.e. Lee Kum Kee)1/4 cup low-sodium soy salt1/4 cup mirin or chicken stock1 tablespoon honey1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger root1 tablespoon coarsely chopped fresh garlic1/2 teaspoon coarsely cracked black pepper1 tablespoon cornstarch2 teaspoons dark sesame oil1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons chopped scallions (white and tender green)Directions:1) Spray interior of slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray. Place pork cubes in slow cooker. Combine black bean garlic sauce, soy sauce, mirin, honey, ginger, garlic, pepper and cornstarch in a small bowl; stir to dissolve cornstarch. Pour over ribs.2) Cook, covered, on LOW setting for 5 to 6 hours until ribs are tender but still hold their shape. Transfer ribs to a rimmed serving platter; tent with foil to keep warm. Strain liquid into a small pan. Bring liquid to a boil over medium-high heat; cook until mixture begins to thicken and is reduced by half. Stir in sesame oil. Add sauce and 1/4 cup scallions to pork cubes.  Mix well. Garnish with reserved 2 tablespoons scallions. Yield: 6 to 8 servings.",

In a large glass or ceramic dish, mix orange juice, olive oil, wine, soy sauce, Sriracha or Tabasco sauce, molasses, garlic, ginger and pepper.\nCut orange, peppers, onion & broccoli into large bite-sized chunks (at least 1\" thick) and place in the dish.\nAdd mushrooms and tomatoes.\nStir veggies in marinade to coat.\nCover and refrigerate while you prep chicken.\nWarm outdoor grill to medium heat.\nRinse chicken and pat dry with paper towel (toss that towel!).\nIn small bowl mix mustard, salt and pepper. Brush chicken with mustard mixture.\nWash your hands and go stir those veggies so all sides absorb the marinade.\nWhen beer is half empty, refill can with salad dressing and squeeze in juice from 1/2 lemon.\nPut can on a disposable baking sheet. Place upright chicken on can like a stand, inserting can into cavity of chicken.\nPlace baking sheet with beer and chicken on the preheated grill.\nCover. Set your time for 1 hour.\nStart on a second beer or that remaining white wine.\nIn a medium saucepan, pour rice, water, and 3-4 splashes of your beverage (about 1/4 cup) into medium sauce pan.\nBring to a boil, stir and reduce heat to low.\nCover with lid and cook for 25-30 minutes.\nBack to the kebabs.\nRemove veggies from fridge and using the sharp end of the skewer begin threading.\nDistribute veggies evenly onto 6-8 skewers.\nCheck rice: It's done when all liquid is absorbed but before it starts sticking to the bottom of the pan.\nTurn off heat under the rice and let it sit.\nGo back to grill.\nYou should be at about an hour on the chicken.\nCarefully slice in to see meat has gone from pink to white.\nRemove from grill\nAllow to cool for at least 15 minutes so you don't burn the hell out of yourself cutting it into pieces for your guest(s).\nIn the meantime throw those kebabs directly on the grill.\nFlip them over after about 5 minutes to get the other side and allow to cook for another 5-8min.\nKebabs are done when veggies are al dente (softened but still firm).\nTurn off grill and remove from heat.\nPut rice in a serving dish, and chicken pieces and full skewers on a platter. Squeeze remaining lemon juice over chicken.\nLet people serve themselves.\nEat, drink and be merry!\nDW | Food and Drink\n",

Cut it in little pieces, mix with 2 tablespoon of sugar and let sit for at least 1/2 hour. It will extract a lot of water that needs to be drained. Pat rhubarb dry for further use.\nIn a kitchen machine beat together butter, sugar and vanilla extract until the butter is fluffy and the sugar is dissolved. Put in the eggs, one at a time and mix well.\nIn a separate bowl sift together flour, ground almonds, salt and baking powder, add slowly to the egg mixture. Dont over mix.\nFill dough into the spring pan, top with dried rhubarb and bake for 25 min.\nIn the mean time prepare the meringue/ baiser topping. Beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Slowly add the sugar until meringue is firm and shiny.\nSpread the meringue evenly over the rhubarb and decorate with almond slices. Return to the oven for another 15 min. Cover the cake with aluminum foil after 5 min. in case the meringue does turn too dark.\nCool completely before removing the cake from the pan.\n",

        "instructions": "Preheat the oven to *350. Mix the first seven ingredients in a small bowl.\nCut each rack in several pieces and rub the spices over all the rib sections. You can leave the ribs whole if you like the way they look better--I just think they are easier to handle on the grill in smaller pieces! Pour 4 cups of water and 1 tsp. of liquid smoke in a roasting pan.\nPlace the ribs in the pan, top up. Tightly cover the pan with foil and bake for 2 hours. Remove from the oven and rest until ready to grill. Meanwhile, add 1 Tb. oil to a sauce pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and saut for 1-2 minutes. Then add the rest of the ingredients for the BBQ sauce to the sauce pan. Simmer for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nHeat a grill over medium-low heat. Brush the ribs completely with BBQ sauce. Place them on the grill and cook for 20 minutes, turning and brushing every 5 minutes until the desired bark has developed.\nIt's fun to make your own BBQ sauce. But in a pinch, buy a bottled variety you like and simmer for a few minutes with the coffee granules!\n",

        "instructions": "Crust: Using a stand mixer or handheld electric whisk, cream the butter, sugar and vanilla together until lightened. By hand, gently mix in the flour and almonds. Press the resulting crumbs into a 25cm loose-bottomed tin (or several smaller ones if you have decided to make individual servings).\nCustard: Using a stand mixer or handheld electric whisk, cream together the cream cheese and sugar. Add the egg and vanilla and mix to completely combine. Pour into the prepared (uncooked) crust.\nApples: Slice the apples as thinly as possible - a mandoline is good for this. Toss gently in the sugar, cinnamon and lemon. Leave to soften for 10 minutes or so. Arrange in a layer on top of the custard. Start by laying overlapping apple slices all the way round the edge. Next create the 'rose' - arrange the slices in a spiral, standing the apple slices a little on their edge, until the centre hole is completely filled in. Save the smallest, thinnest pieces for the very centre as they will have to bend the most. Cover the tart with tin foil and bake in a preheated oven set at 190c for 30 minutes (this step helps soften the apples). Remove the foil and bake for 15-25 minutes longer, until the custard is puffed and the apple edges are lightly browned.\nGlaze: When you take the tin foil off the apple tart, start making the glaze. Melt the sugar in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and cook until rich and golden. Add the butter and salt and stir to combine. Add the cream and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the ingredients have formed a smooth, unified caramel. When the tart looks nearly ready, remove it from the oven and brush with the glaze. Return to the oven and cook for a further few minutes until the glaze is gently bubbling. Cool to room temperature.  Can be kept in the fridge for several days - store in the baking tin and wrap well.\n",

Stir everything through, set the heat so that your soup is on a gentle simmer, cover and cook for about 25 minutes or until the vegetables are cooked al dente.\nAdd the pasta and cook until the pasta is ready.  Follow the timing instructions on the packet, but this is normally about 7 minutes.\nAdd the cabbage and the beans and cook until the cabbage has wilted.  This will take about 5 minutes.\nCheck for seasoning and add some salt and pepper if needed before serving.\nSprinkle a little parmesan over each bowl of soup.\n",

When the tomatoes have a nice golden color gently flip and finish cooking on the other side.

        "instructions": "This crock-pot entre is really, really good. It takes 10 minutes to prepare, is made from ingredients that are readily available and is a bargain when you consider the number of servings it provides.  One caution -  you'll have mush with  Asian flavor if you cook this for more than 5 to 6 hours. The recipe is adapted from \"Slow Cooker Recipes for All Occasions\",  a Rival Crock-Pot publication.  Served with rice and snow peas you have the makings of a minor feast that you'll repeat often. My family loves this dish. I think yours will, too. This, by the way, is a wonderful recipe for novice cooks. If you have a willing teen, let them have a go at it.Asian-Style Country Ribs with Black Bean Garlic SauceIngredients:3 to 4 pounds boneless country-style pork ribs, cross cut in 1-1/2-inch pieces3 tablespoons prepared black bean garlic sauce from a jar (i.e. Lee Kum Kee)1/4 cup low-sodium soy salt1/4 cup mirin or chicken stock1 tablespoon honey1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger root1 tablespoon coarsely chopped fresh garlic1/2 teaspoon coarsely cracked black pepper1 tablespoon cornstarch2 teaspoons dark sesame oil1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons chopped scallions (white and tender green)Directions:1) Spray interior of slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray. Place pork cubes in slow cooker. Combine black bean garlic sauce, soy sauce, mirin, honey, ginger, garlic, pepper and cornstarch in a small bowl; stir to dissolve cornstarch. Pour over ribs.2) Cook, covered, on LOW setting for 5 to 6 hours until ribs are tender but still hold their shape. Transfer ribs to a rimmed serving platter; tent with foil to keep warm. Strain liquid into a small pan. Bring liquid to a boil over medium-high heat; cook until mixture begins to thicken and is reduced by half. Stir in sesame oil. Add sauce and 1/4 cup scallions to pork cubes.  Mix well. Garnish with reserved 2 tablespoons scallions. Yield: 6 to 8 servings.",

Beat with a whisk until the eggs and cream are incorporated.\nIn an ovenproof saut pan over medium heat, add the butter and olive oil. When the mixture is hot, add the asparagus pieces and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring. Add the garlic and cook for about a minute. Spread the asparagus so it is evenly distributed across the bottom of the pan.\nAdd the egg mixture to the pan and allow the eggs to cook without mixing them. Use a rubber spatula to run around the edges of the frittata as it cooks so the edges dont stick and burn. After 1-2 minutes, add the cheese evenly to the egg mixture.\nWhen the outer edges of the frittata have set but the center is still slightly runny, arrange the cherry tomatoes and asparagus spears on the top of the frittata, sprinkle the remaining thyme over the top, then remove the pan from the heat and place it in an oven set to broil.\nThe broiler will allow the top portion of the egg mixture to set and cook thoroughly. Keep a close watch so the frittata doesnt burn.\nAfter a few minutes, when the eggs have set completely and begin to turn golden, carefully remove the pan from the oven.\nUse a rubber spatula to run around the edges and underside of the frittata, and slide it onto a round serving plate.\nSlice and serve warm or at room temperature.\n",

Meanwhile, combine dates, brandy, coffee, and 2 tablespoons cocoa in a heatproof bowl. Stir in boiling water. Let cool, stirring occasionally. Puree cooled date mixture in a food processor (you should have about 2 1/2 cups). Place puree in a large bowl.\nWhisk flour, salt, cinnamon, and remaining 2 tablespoons cocoa in a bowl. Beat butter and dark-brown sugar with a mixer on medium speed until fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition (batter will look curdled). Stir baking soda into reserved uncovered date puree. On low speed, beat flour mixture into egg mixture in 2 additions, alternating with the date mixture.\nBeat in chocolate and chopped dates. Transfer batter to prepared pan, and smooth top.\nBake until a toothpick inserted into center of cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let cool in pan on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Run a knife around edge of pan to loosen, and invert cake onto rack.\nRemove parchment, turn cake right side up, and let cool completely. (Cake can be wrapped in plastic and stored at room temperature for up to 2 days.)\nMake the glaze:\nBring butter, dark-brown sugar, water, and salt to a boil in a saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally. Boil 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Whisk in cream. Add chocolate, and whisk until smooth. Whisk in brandy. Let cool until thickened, 15 to 20 minutes.\nPlace cake on stand and pour glaze over top, letting some drip down sides. Garnish with halved dates.\n",

        "instructions": "Soak saffron in warm milk for 15 to 20 minutes.\nIn the meantime, dry roast the cinnamon stick, black cardamom seeds, green cardamom seeds, pepper corns and cloves. Pound them to a powder (not very fine).\nIn a mortar and pestle grind the green chillies to a paste. (Using a pinch of coarse salt will help)\nMix all the ingredients together and your marinade is ready.\nEnsure that you pat dry the chicken cubes.\nTransfer the chicken in a bowl\nAdd the marinade to the chicken cubes and mix it well so that all pieces are well coated.\nCover the bowl with a cling film and put it in the refrigerator.\nLeave the chicken to marinate over-night. (I marinated for almost 18 hours and the result was moist and tender chicken tikkas)\nI grilled these tikkas in my non-stick grill pan. Using a non-stick pan helped me keep the amount of oil to minimal.\nSoak the skewers in water for at least half an hour before you intend to serve them.\nNow take the skewers and start skewering the chicken pieces on them. I leave a little space in between the chicken pieces; else they stick together and do not get cooked well. (Perhaps the reason could be pan grilling)\nKeep the skewers ready and then heat the pan (medium hot).\nYou can use an oil spray or pour a little oil using a spoon in a linear fashion across the grill pan.\nPlace the skewers over the oiled pan and grill them on medium low heat.\nIt will take approximately 45 seconds to a minute for one side to get cooked.\nThen turn around and cook the other side the same way.\nServe them hot as a starter or as a main course with Bakarkhani!! Bon apptit!!\n",

Lay ribs flat in a glass or ceramic dish and pour marinade over them. Allow to marinate at least 4 hours; better still, refrigerate overnight for maximum flavor. Bring to room temperature before grilling.\nRemove ribs from marinade. Scrape marinade from ribs with a rubber spatula and reserve. Grill ribs over a slow fire for about 40 minutes, turning frequently; fire should not flare up and burn them.\nPlace reserved marinade in a saucepan and add sugar and honey. Heat only until the sugar is dissolved. Brush on ribs and continue grilling about 20 minutes more, basting as often as necessary to keep ribs moist.\nSlice ribs just before serving. To serve, put 2 to 3 tablespoons of sauce on a plate and lay 2 or 3 ribs on top.\nNOTES : Jack Burson, a friend from Birmingham, Alabama, has told me that his hometown offers some of the best barbecue he has eaten. Now that he's a neighbor in New York, we cook together frequently. Here is our version of one of the best-ever barbecue sauces.\n",

When finished, remove and set aside.\nAllow the other vegetables to cook, turning, until they are tender and lightly charred (10-12 minutes). The corn may take a few minutes longer than the other vegetables. If needed, remove the other vegetables and allow the corn to continue to cook.\nWhen the vegetables have cooled enough to touch, cut the corn off the cob, and dice the other vegetables.\nIn a large bowl, combine the tomatoes, corn, onion, peppers, garlic, and cilantro, and toss to mix.\nAdd the avocado to the mixture, lightly tossing and mashing it.\nAdd the lime juice and seasoning. Mix together and adjust as needed.\nAdd the pistachios, toss the mixture again and serve.\n",

Bring to a boil and them simmer on low for 30 minutes.  Once the broth is done simmering you will want to strain it through some cheese cloth.  The lemongrass stalks are not edible, I found that out the hard way.\nBring the broth back to a simmer and add the tofu, mushrooms, snow peas and the rice noodles.\nYou can add the lime juice at any time.\nI added some lime juice at the beginning and then some at the end before serving.\nSimmer until the noodles are soft.\nGarnish with grated ginger or scallions.\n",

Whether you are a student studying for finals or a mom trying to organize all of your upcoming holiday festivities, you will appreciate this super easy and filling meal.This Easy Homemade Rice and Beans recipe is great served as a light dinner or as a side to accompany your favorite Mexican dish.

And being just as easy as the store bought version, this recipe is definitely a winner. Plus, everything tastes better homemade, right?!Add all of the ingredients to one pot, let simmer for 20 minutes (or however long it takes your rice to cook), and you have yourself a delicious dish. Hard to beat that! And in that 20 minutes it takes for these rice and beans to cook, take a few minutes to sit down and get off your feet, maybe even make a drink, and just relax.

        "instructions": "In a large bowl, add mustard, bread crumbs, egg, garlic powder, salt and pepper to ground elk meat. Mix all ingredients by hand and then form into small patties. Use a  cup measuring cup to size how much meat to use when forming your patties.  Place meat on tinfoil and press gently with your thumb creating a small indent in the center. This will help keep patties from shrinking when cooking.\nPre-heat the barbecue to high temperature.\nI recommend leaving the elk burgers on the tinfoil while cooking on the BBQ. The elk meat is very lean and can have the tendency to dry out if overcooked. Cooking on tinfoil reduces the risk of overcooking.\nCook 7 minutes or until brown and then flip patties. Continue cooking on other side until brown  7 minutes. Add smoked mozzarella cheese to the top of burgers during the last 2 minutes of cooking. Close lid and melt cheese.\nWhile cooking your burgers, place pancetta bacon slices on tinfoil and place on the barbeque for the last few minutes of cooking. Toast buns on grill.\nPlace elk sliders on Hawaiian Sweet Rolls, top with a slice of pancetta bacon and a few cherry tomatoes and you are set! Enjoy!\n",

Pour in your stock juice so it would cook the rice for the next 20-25 minutes on low heat. Constantly check to make sure the rice is soft and when it is, increase the heat and stir.Toss in the already saut\u00e9ed pineapple and chopped vegetables and stir in.Serve with any protein of your choice.\u00a0",

        "instructions": "Roasted Garlic Instructions:\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F.\nCut the top off the bulb of garlic, exposing the cloves.\nPlace the garlic on a sheet of foil large enough to wrap it up.\nDrizzle olive oil over top of garlic bulb and sprinkle with salt.\nTightly wrap the garlic in the foil.\nPlace foil in the oven and cook for 45 minutes.\nRemove and unwrap garlic. Turn upside down and squeeze the cloves out of the garlic skin\nWhole Wheat Pizza Dough Instructions:\nPlace all ingredients (except 2 tbsp olive oil) in a food processor or a stand mixer with dough hook. If using a food processor, process until dough forms into a ball. Add extra water, 1 tbsp at a time if dough is too dry. If using a stand mixer, mix with dough hook until all of the flour is mixed together.\nIf you have time, place dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 20-30 minutes.\nLightly flour surface and roll dough out until it is 1/2 inch thick. I chose to use a large bowl and cut out circular pizzas. This required me to roll the dough out three times, making 2 larger pizzas and one smaller one. You could also opt to roll it out until it is a rectangle.\nPlace pizza on pizza stone or on greased cookie sheet. Set aside.\nBrush pizza dough lightly with olive oil (no more than 2 tbsp total).\nPizza Topping Instructions:\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F.\nLine a baking sheet with foil and spray with non-stick cooking spray.\nPlace cubed red onion and sweet potato on the sheet.\nDrizzle with 1-2 tbsp olive oil, and sprinkle with thyme, rosemary, salt and pepper.\nRoast for 25-30 minutes, mixing the vegetables around occasionally. (I roasted my garlic at the same time).\nRemove and set aside.\nTake your freshly roasted bulb of garlic and squeeze the garlic out into a mortar bowl (if you don't have one, use a bowl). Crush the garlic with either a pestle or the bottom of a spoon until it is a paste.\nSpread the roasted garlic paste over the pizza dough.\nSprinkle/crumble your cheese of choice over the pizza dough.\nPlace the vegetables on top of the cheese.\nCook pizza for approximately 20 minutes (plus or minus a few minutes depending on your oven), waiting for the crust to become golden brown.\nEnjoy!\n",

        "instructions": "In a pan, saut garlic in olive oil until light brown.\nAdd onions. Saute until almost translucent.\nAdd the ground pork and sprinkle with  tsp salt and  tsp blackpepper. Stir-fry until no more pink color is showing.\nAdd carrots, oyster sauce and fish sauce.  Mix well.\nAdd shrimps and cook until pink then add egg. Mix well and remove from heat. Allow to completely cool down. Drain if necessary. Set aside the sauce.\nThe lumpia wrappers are very tightly packed, so be careful when pulling them apart. If you cannot find lumpia wrappers, you can use spring roll wrappers.\nSpoon 1 Tbsp mixture on the lower edge of the wrapper leaving 1 inch edge. Begin to fold egg roll like an envelope: first, fold over the lower 1 inch edge over the filing, then the left edge, then the right edge, then roll up to the top edge. To seal the wrapper just moisten the top edge with water. I used the sauce I got from draining the cooked mixture.\nHeat vegetable oil in a large, deep frying pan over medium high heat. Place egg roll one at a time into hot oil, with the seam down (this will keep it from unraveling) and then quickly turn the egg roll to ensure the skin crisp up and does not stick to other egg rolls in the pan. Adjust heat so that the oil is bubbling gently and not too vigorously around the egg rolls. Each egg roll will take about 5 minutes to cook. Shake the egg roll over the pan to help remove the excess oil. Place egg roll on layers of paper towels to drain.\nServe the lumpia or Filipino egg rolls with your favorite sweet and sour sauce or a spicy vinegar sauce.\nNutritional information is for 1 egg roll.\n",

Cool, stirring occasionally to just above body temperature.\nPour remaining 1/4 cup whipping cream into a metal measuring cup and sprinkle in the gelatin. Allow gelatin to \"bloom\" for 10 minutes. Then carefully heat by swirling the measuring cup over a low gas flame or candle. Do not boil or gelatin will be damaged. Stir mixture into the cooled chocolate and set aside.\nIn the chilled mixing bowl, beat cream to medium peaks. Stir 1/4 of the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture to lighten it. Fold in the remaining whipped cream in two doses. There may be streaks of whipped cream in the chocolate and that is fine. Do not over work the mousse.\nSpoon into bowls, chocolate cups (see note in About section) or martini glasses and chill for at least 1 hour. Garnish with fruit and serve.\n(If mousse is to be refrigerated overnight, chill for one hour and then cover each with plastic wrap)\n",

        "instructions": "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.In a medium bowl, combine the peanut butter, maple syrup, vanilla and 2 tablespoons of the coconut flour until well blended. Add additional coconut flour if the peanut mixture is too soft  it should be pliable and easy to form into shapes with your hands.Using a tablespoon or ice cream scoop, drop spoonfuls of the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Form into balls and flatten each ball slightly with your fingers. Place in the freezer for 20 to 30 minutes until firm.Melt the chocolate in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring often, until melted. Let cool for a few minutes and then dip each of the frozen peanut butter pieces into the chocolate to coat completely. Using a fork is a good way to do this and be sure to work quickly.Transfer each peanut butter cup back to the baking sheet and return to the freezer. Sprinkle with a little coarse sea salt if desired. Chill until set, about 1 hour or more. These will keep well in the freezer for several days, if they last that long.Note: You can make a half batch instead, but these are so good, you won't want to do that, especially as they keep so well.",

        "instructions": "Prepare the graham crust: Preheat the oven to 350.\nPut the graham crackers into a food processor and pulse until the crackers break down to the consistency of sand. Transfer to a large bowl. Stir in the salt and melted butter and mix until the butter has thoroughly incorporated; it should be the consistency of wet sand.\nPress and pack the wet graham mixture into six buttered 4 -inch tart pans, making sure it goes up all the way on the sides and that the crust is thick and sturdy.\nArrange the tarts on 1 or 2 cookie sheets and bake for 12 minutes, or until the crusts are golden, but not browned. Remove the tart shells from the oven and set aside to cool.\nIf you are not using spring form pans, carefully remove the crusts from the pans at this stage and follow the recipe as follows.\nThe tart crusts can be stored in airtight plastic containers, in a single layer, for up to 24 hours.\nPrepare the lime curd: Put the lime juice, sugar, eggs, and yolks in a stainless steel bowl and whisk well.\nFill a saucepan halfway with water, and bring the water to a boil over high heat, then lower the heat so the water is simmering. Set the bowl over the pot and whisk the lime mixture occasionally until it thickens, approximately 10 minutes. Then whisk in the butter, 1 piece at a time. When all of the butter is melted and incorporated, stir in the lime zest and remove the saucepan from the heat.\nRemove the bowl from the saucepan and let it cool for 5 minutes.\nTransfer the mixture to a blender or food processor, and blend until very smooth. You can also use an immersion/hand blender instead, if you have one.\nThe mixture can be made, cooled, covered, and refrigerated for up to 1 week.\nDivide the mixture among the tart shells, leaving about half of space on the top for the chocolate ganache layer. Chill in the refrigerator while making the chocolate ganache, or until set.\nPrepare the chocolate ganache: Over a double boiler (simmer water over low heat in a saucepan and put a heat-resistant bowl on top), melt the chocolate together with the sugar and butter. Stir constantly until the sugar is well incorporated and the mixture is smooth and shiny.\nRemove the melted chocolate from the heat and let it cool for 5 minutes.\nCarefully, pour the liquid chocolate ganache over each tartlet, making sure that the chocolate does not over-flow the graham crust sides. Return the tarts to the refrigerator and chill for 1 to 2 hours, or until the ganache has set. (The ganache on top should take on a smooth matte finish.)\nPrepare the meringue and finish the tarts: In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a whip attachment, whip the reserved egg whites until frothy. Slowly add the sugar, then the cream of tartar, continuing to whip until well incorporated. Increase the stand mixer to medium speed and whip until the whites are shiny and form a stiff peak. Do not over-whip or they will become grainy.\nTransfer the meringue into a pastry bag fitted with a star tip, and pipe it around the edge of each tart. Or, transfer it into a large freezer bag, seal tightly, and snip off one corner. Pipe the meringue on as desired.\nUsing a brulee torch, quickly brown the meringue, being careful not to melt the chocolate ganache on top. (Due to the chocolate ganache layer, the meringues should not be browned under a broiler.)\n",

        "instructions": "Crust: Using a stand mixer or handheld electric whisk, cream the butter, sugar and vanilla together until lightened. By hand, gently mix in the flour and almonds. Press the resulting crumbs into a 25cm loose-bottomed tin (or several smaller ones if you have decided to make individual servings).\nCustard: Using a stand mixer or handheld electric whisk, cream together the cream cheese and sugar. Add the egg and vanilla and mix to completely combine. Pour into the prepared (uncooked) crust.\nApples: Slice the apples as thinly as possible - a mandoline is good for this. Toss gently in the sugar, cinnamon and lemon. Leave to soften for 10 minutes or so. Arrange in a layer on top of the custard. Start by laying overlapping apple slices all the way round the edge. Next create the 'rose' - arrange the slices in a spiral, standing the apple slices a little on their edge, until the centre hole is completely filled in. Save the smallest, thinnest pieces for the very centre as they will have to bend the most. Cover the tart with tin foil and bake in a preheated oven set at 190c for 30 minutes (this step helps soften the apples). Remove the foil and bake for 15-25 minutes longer, until the custard is puffed and the apple edges are lightly browned.\nGlaze: When you take the tin foil off the apple tart, start making the glaze. Melt the sugar in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and cook until rich and golden. Add the butter and salt and stir to combine. Add the cream and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the ingredients have formed a smooth, unified caramel. When the tart looks nearly ready, remove it from the oven and brush with the glaze. Return to the oven and cook for a further few minutes until the glaze is gently bubbling. Cool to room temperature.  Can be kept in the fridge for several days - store in the baking tin and wrap well.\n",

Stir everything very well, add salt and pepper, about 1/2 tsp each. Stir again and let cook over medium heat, until water evaporates and vegetables wilt nicely, and cabbage becomes translucent. It should still retain a bit of a light crunch. Remove from heat.\nWhisk eggs and milk in a separate bowl. Add about 1/2 cup bread crumbs and 1/2 the cheese. Stir well.\nAdd egg mix to the cabbage mix and stir until well distributed.\nHeat the oven to 375F.\nIn a casserole dish spread a handful of bread crumbs on the bottom.\nFold out the gratin mix into the casserole and spread evenly.\nCoat with remaining cheese and bread crumbs uniformly.\nDrizzle melted butter on top.\nBake for 35-40 minutes, or until top is nicely browned.\n",

When heated, start to fry your french toast.  It's going to be really soft of be careful not to tear or break it.\nWhen your french toast is done, turn the heat off and put about 1 tablespoon of white sugar on top of each piece.  Spread it around so it's in a thin layer.  Then, fire up the kitchen torch and brulee the tops of the toast.\nOnce bruleed, we topped our toast with whipped cream and a basic fruit salad (strawberries, black berries and pineapple).\nEnjoy!\n",

Keep the spread on the side, you will need to grease more as you go along.\nWith a baking measuring cup in 1/4 cup size, scoop up batter and drop into the hot pan.  When you see little bubbles forming it is time to flip the pancakes (1-2 minutes), cook another minute until done.  Serve hot or warm.\nMakes about 12 pancakes. Serving size is 3 pancakes.\n",

        "instructions": "In a bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter until light and fluffy.\nIn a separate small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, ground ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and salt. Set aside.\nAdd the sugar to the butter and beat until light and fluffy. Turn the mixer to low and mix in the molasses, egg and balsamic vinegar. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the bowl and continue mixing until thoroughly combined.\nCover and chill about 2 hours or until the dough is easy to handle.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees.\nDivide the dough in half and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll each half of the dough to 1/4\" thickness adding flour as needed, the dough is very sticky so use flour liberally to prevent your cutouts from sticking to the surface.\nUsing cookie cutters, cut dough into shapes and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment approximately 1\" apart.\nBake in a 400 degree oven for 5-6 minutes. Cool on baking sheets for one minute and move to a wire rack.\nIn a small bowl, combine the powdered sugar, vanilla and milk. Whisk to combine. Spoon mixture into a pastry bag or zip top bag and snip off the tip. Add two small dots of icing where the eyes should be and then press one eye on each dot. Decorate the mummies using a zig-zag pattern across the surface of the cookie and allow to dry for 2-4 hours or overnight.\nStore in an airtight container.\n",

In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Pour butter into the bowl with bread, and toss. Set the breadcrumbs aside. In a medium saucepan set over medium heat, heat milk. Melt remaining 6 tablespoons butter in a high-sided skillet over medium heat. When butter bubbles, add flour. Cook, stirring, 1 minute.\nSlowly pour hot milk into flour-butter mixture while whisking. Continue cooking, whisking constantly, until the mixture bubbles and becomes thick.\nRemove the pan from the heat. Stir in salt, nutmeg, black pepper, cayenne pepper, 3 cups cheddar, and 1 1/2 cups Gruyere. Set cheese sauce aside.\nFill a large saucepan with water. Bring to a boil. Add macaroni; cook 2 to 3 fewer minutes than manufacturers directions, until outside of pasta is cooked and inside is underdone. (Different brands of macaroni cook at different rates; be sure to read the instructions.) Transfer the macaroni to a colander, rinse under cold running water, and drain well. Stir macaroni into the reserved cheese sauce.\nPour the mixture into the prepared casserole dish. Sprinkle remaining 1 1/2 cups cheddar and 1/2 cup Gruyere; scatter breadcrumbs over the top. Bake until browned on top, about 30 minutes. Transfer dish to a wire rack to cool for 5 minutes; serve.\n",

Press into the bottom of a greased 9-inch spring form pan; set aside.\nIn a mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese and sugar until smooth.\nAdd sour cream and cornstarch, beating well.\nAdd eggs, and beat on low speed just until combined.\nDrain the cranberry sauce, reserve the cranberries. Fold one cup of cranberry sauce into the mixture. Pour into crust, sprinkle with the remaining sauce.\nBake the cake at 160C for 30-35 minutes or until the center is almost set. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Carefully run a knife around the edge of the pan to loosen; cool one hour longer. Refrigerate overnight.\nBefore serving, if you wish, top the cake with cranberries from the sauce.\n",

In a large bowl, cream together butter, sugar and brown sugar until light. Beat in egg, milk and vanilla extract. With the mixer on low speed or by hand, blend in the flour mixture, stirring only until no streaks of flour remain. Stir in chocolate chips.\nDivide dough into two equal parts. Place each on a sheet of wax or parchment paper and shape into a log. Wrap in paper and chill logs for 1-2 hours, until firm.\nMake the filling by combining all ingredients in a medium bowl and mix at medium-high speed until smooth. Set aside.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nRemove dough logs from the fridge. Using a sharp knife, divide each log into eight even slices (total of 16 big slices of cookie dough).\nWorking with one piece of cookie dough at a time, flatten the dough into a 3-4 inch wide dish between your palms. Place about 1 tablespoon cream cheese filling in the center of the dough, then pinch the side of the dough together to seal. Work carefully so all the filling is sealed inside.\nPlace on the baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough.\nBake for 15-18 minutes, until cookies are golden brown around the edges. Cool on the baking sheet for 2-3 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.\nMakes 16 gut busting cookies.\n",

Stir in crab and bread crumbs.\nIn a small bowl whisk together mayonnaise, seafood seasoning, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste and stir into crab mixture until combined well.\nLine a baking sheet with wax paper. Form crab mixture into 6 flattened rounds. Chill crab cakes, covered with plastic wrap, at least 1 hour.\nHeat 1 tablespoon butter over moderate heat until foam subsides and cook half of crab cakes until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Cook remaining cakes in remaining tablespoon butter in same manner.\nPrepare Knorr Hollandaise Sauce according to package instructions.\nPoach the eggs:\nFill a medium sized sauce pan half way with water. Add 1/2 teaspoon of white vinegar (this is optional but the vinegar helps hold the egg together). Bring to a gentle boil and carefully add eggs (1-2 at a time works best). Poach eggs for 2-3 minutes or until yolk has set to your preference. Remove eggs one at a time with a slotted spoon.\nAssemble: Layer ingredients as follows: English muffin, crab cakes (1 each muffin), eggs, Hollandaise sauce.\n",

Heat oil on high. Oil is ready when a little dough thrown in floats to top. Carefully add dough to oil in heaping teaspoons. Cook until brown, about 2 minutes, then flip. Cook another 1-2 minutes, until both sides are browned. Transfer briefly to paper towels to absorb excess oil, then transfer to cooling rack. Make glaze by stirring milk and powdered sugar together in a small bowl. Drizzle over apple fritters. Wait approximately 3 minutes for glaze to harden, then flip fritters and drizzle glaze over the other side. Best served warm.",

Place on grill and brown for a few minutes, covered.  Baste with some maple syrup and continue to grill for about 20-25 minutes, turning and basting occasionally with the maple syrup.\nThe pork should be done in 20-25 minutes total, or until the internal temperature reaches about 150 and the bacon is uniformly crispy.\nRemove from grill and let sit at room temperature for about 5 minutes before slicing.

Set aside.In the bowl of your stand mixer, with paddle attachment fixed (or a handheld electric mixer may be used), combine the cream cheese, blueberry jam, 2 tablespoons of confectioner's sugar, flour, salt and  teaspoon of almond extract. Mix until smooth, about 30 seconds. Set aside.Lay your crescent roll wedges out on a large work surface. Take about a tablespoon of the cream cheese mixture and dollop it on the wide end of each crescent roll. Roll them up until the narrow end is sealed underneath. Transfer them to the prepared baking sheet and brush them with the egg wash. Sprinkle with turbinado sugar.Place the crescent rolls in the oven and bake for 13-15 minutes, or until puffed and golden. Remove from heat and transfer to a wire rack to cool.While the crescent rolls are cooling, prepare your glaze. In a medium bowl, combine the remaining  cup of confectioner's sugar, remaining  teaspoon of almond extract, and milk. Whisk until smooth. Adjust seasoning by adding a pinch of sea salt if you find that the glaze is too sweet. Drizzle the glaze on the slightly cooled crescent rolls and serve immediately. Enjoy!",

Bring the mixture almost to a boil.\nPut the pan on low heat, add the chocolate, and whisk until the chocolate starts to melt. Combine the cornstarch and water to form a slurry. Add the slurry a little at a time, whisking constantly, until the soup is thick and smooth. You will know it is ready when the bubbles are gone and the chocolate has thickened, about 5 to 7 minutes. Carefully pour into two bowls and garnish.\nTopping: Microwave the cream cheese at 10 second intervals or until it can be stirred smooth. Add marshmallow creme to the cream cheese and mix well. Dollop on top of soup, or transfer mixture to pastry bag and pipe design.\n",

Shake and squeeze the contents of the bag to dissolve the honey and brown sugar. Add the chicken drumsticks to the bag and seal with as little air as possible in the bag. Place in the refrigerator and marinate for 2 hours.\nPreheat the oven to 450 degrees F.\nPlace the chicken drumsticks on a foil-lined baking sheet. Bake until the skin is caramelized and very dark in spots, about 30 to 35 minutes.\nMeanwhile, place the marinade in a small saucepan. Bring the marinade to a boil. Reduce the heat to simmer and cook over low heat until thick, about 15 minutes. Reserve.\nUse a pastry brush to brush some of the boiled marinade on the cooked chicken. Place the chicken on a serving platter. Sprinkle with the sesame seeds and the chopped parsley.\n",

Add the curry leaves or bay leaf and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 1 hour or until the beans are tender but not falling apart. Drain and transfer to a large salad bowl.Meanwhile, snap the woody ends off of the asparagus spears and steam the spears for 6 minutes or until just tender but still retaining their crunch. Transfer to the salad bowl.Now cook the mushrooms. Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat. As soon as the oil is hot, drop in the mushrooms and cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes or until the mushrooms begin to brown and lose some of their liquid. Transfer to the bowl with the asparagus.To make the dressing, combine the tarragon, lemon zest, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil and mustard in a small food processor or blender. Process until smooth.Pour the dressing over the salad, season with salt and pepper, and toss. Serve at room temperature or chilled.",

Set aside.In a separate medium bowl, whisk together 2 cups of the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, xantham gum and fine sea salt.Add the dry ingredients to the wet and mix to combine until just moistened. Do not overmix.In a small bowl, combine 1 cup of the blueberries with the remaining 1 tablespoon flour. Fold the blueberries into the batter very gently until dispersed evenly. It is OK if they bleed just a little bit.Pour the batter into the prepared pan and flatten and even out with a spatula. Top with the remaining blueberries.In a small bowl toss the turbinado sugar and almonds together. Sprinkle on top of the cake. Transfer the cake to the oven ad bake for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick comes out with just a few crumbs. Remove from heat and let cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Release the sides and transfer the cake to a wire rack to cool the rest of the way.Enjoy immediately or cover with plastic wrap and eat within 2 days.",

I find its faster when the nuts are still hot compared to cold ones.\nAdd in the chocolate and continue mixing until its a paste. Put in the almond milk and you will get a nice smooth texture, really spreadable.\n",

        "instructions": "Directions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a 9 by 9 or 7 by 11 baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.\nCombine the flax, applesauce and almond milk together in a small bowl. Set aside to allow to thicken. In a food processor, combine the blueberries, pear, black beans and oil. Pulse until the mixture become very smooth. Next, add the extracts and process until fully combined. Remove the contents from processor into a medium sized mixing bowl. Add the coconut sugar, cocoa, baking powder, soda, and salt and mix. Add the flour with the chocolate chips and mix until just combined. Pour the batter into your prepared dish and bake at 350 for 44-45 minutes.\nRemove from the oven and allow to cool for at least 50 minutes. If you would like, place the brownies in the fridge for 20 or 30 minutes to speed up cooling time. While the brownies cool, start on your mint filling.\nIn a small bowl, combine the soft avocado with full fat coconut milk or heavy cream. Beat on high for about 5 minutes until the mixture is fluffy and smooth. Add the powdered xylitol and mix well. Add peppermint extract and coloring if desired, and beat until all incorporated. Once the mixture is perfectly fluffy and creamy, add the flour and mix until just combined. The mixture should be thick and smooth but still easy to spread. Spread the mixture evenly over the cooled brownies and place in the fridge for 10 minutes, until the mint filling has firmed.\nNext, melt the chocolate. Add the oil to the melted chocolate and stir to combine. Remove the brownies from the fridge and pour the melted chocolate over the brownies, gently and quickly spread the chocolate evenly over the brownies. The mint filling should be cold so the warm chocolate doesnt melt the mint filling, but the chocolate will cool quickly once it touches the cold mint. Make sure to work quickly so the chocolate layer will be even. Return the brownies to the fridge to cool for another 5 minutes until the chocolate is set.\nCut the brownies after the 5 minutes with a sharp knife. Serve brownies chilled or at room temperature. Store any left overs in an airtight container in the refrigerator.\nNOTE: Once the chocolate layer has firmed, be sure to cut all the brownies immediately with a sharp knife. I cut some of the brownies when they were really, really cold, and they didnt cut clean and pretty.\n*For those who are not concerned with gluten content, wheat or white flour would work okay as well. For wheat, decrease the amount by 1 tablespoon. For the filling, be sure to use a white color flour to keep the mint filling a bright pretty green color.\n**You can use any kind of chocolate you like, but dark chocolate gives a wonderful flavor to the peppermint and sugar free dark chocolate is the easiest to find.\n",

        "instructions": "Yes, these are called SPICY hot wings for a reason. I like adding the brown sugar to give them a little sweeter taste, but it is by far a delicious spicy recipe more than anything.To get started, mix the brown sugar, crushed garlic, hot sauce, and cayenne pepper into a medium mixing bowl. Mix well and then set aside.Take the cooking spray and spray the entire inside portion of the slow cooker AND also the wings. (Spraying the wings before you grill, bake, or cook chicken keeps the flavor and makes them super juicy. TRUST ME.)Take the wings and add them into the mixing bowl with your spices and toss to get a good even coat over the wings.Place in the slow cooker on low for 4 hours. After 4hours, remove carefully and place on a prepared cookie sheet. Place in the oven under broiler setting for 4-6 minutes, allowing the wings to get a little crisp.Serve immediately with a little blue cheese dressing and celery.",

        "instructions": "Place the shallots, garlic, chile peppers, lemongrass, turmeric, coriander, cumin, nutmeg, black pepper, salt, shrimp paste, and sugar in the bowl of food processor, and puree until a rough paste forms. In a large bowl, mix the paste with minced chicken, grated coconut, and lime leaves.\nHeat a grill or grill pan to hot. Place approximately 1 1/2 ounces chicken mixture on the end of a chopstick, and grill until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Taste for seasoning, and adjust the chicken mixture with salt and pepper as necessary. Place remaining chicken mixture on ends of chopsticks, and grill.\nTo serve, place skewers on a platter. Garnish with cucumber, onion, jicama, pickled garlic, and escarole. Serve with the satay peanut sauce on the side.\nTo make the Satay Peanut Sauce: Finely chop the chiles, garlic, shallots, lemongrass, ginger, coriander seeds, and cumin seeds. Place in a mini food processor or blender, and process until fine. Heat the oil, and fry spice paste for several minutes. Add the tamarind pulp, sugar, and fish sauce; simmer 2 minutes more. Add 2/3 cup water and the coconut milk, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat; add crushed peanuts. Mix thoroughly, and remove from heat.\nServes 4.\n",

        "instructions": "Preheat oven to 375F with the rack in middle position.\nMake the Scone Mix.\nUsing a Food Processor fitted with a steel knife blade: Place half the butter and half the dry ingredients in the bowl. Pulse until the butter is reduced to pea-sized pieces, with dough still dry. Transfer first half of the mix into a large bowl. Repeat process with the other half of the ingredients and add to the large bowl.\nBy hand: Place all the ingredients in a large bowl and use a pastry cutter to incorporate the butter into the dough. Cut by pressing on butter, then gathering flour onto it in two quick strokes.  Cut until butter slices become pea-sized.\nDont over process or mix. Dough will be dry. Break large lumps of butter by hand, and toss dry dough with your fingers.\nBlend the cheeses, dill, shallot and pepper with the Scone Mix using a wooden spoon. Drizzle the buttermilk over the dough and drop the cottage cheese in the middle, and stir until mixed. Add more buttermilk if dough is too dry to hold together.\nPlace dough on a lightly floured surface and divide into two. Form 2 discs and flatten each to a thickness of about 1-1/2 inches, cut into 6 wedges for a total of 12. Arrange an inch apart on a cookie sheet.\nBake for 15 minutes, rotate the pan, and bake another 10 to 15 minutes, until scones are light brown on top and darker at the bottom. Bread should no longer be soft and doughy in the center. Bake in 2 batches if scones dont fit in one cookie sheet.\nServe warm or cool in a wire rack before wrapping in foil or plastic wrap/bag. Freshly baked scones can be kept at room temperature for up to 2 days, and in the refrigerator for a week.\n",

Set aside.In a separate medium bowl, whisk together 2 cups of the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, xantham gum and fine sea salt.Add the dry ingredients to the wet and mix to combine until just moistened. Do not overmix.In a small bowl, combine 1 cup of the blueberries with the remaining 1 tablespoon flour. Fold the blueberries into the batter very gently until dispersed evenly. It is OK if they bleed just a little bit.Pour the batter into the prepared pan and flatten and even out with a spatula. Top with the remaining blueberries.In a small bowl toss the turbinado sugar and almonds together. Sprinkle on top of the cake. Transfer the cake to the oven ad bake for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick comes out with just a few crumbs. Remove from heat and let cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Release the sides and transfer the cake to a wire rack to cool the rest of the way.Enjoy immediately or cover with plastic wrap and eat within 2 days.",

Use a food processor to chop them to the finest size possible. (A 2-pound bag of almonds is what you'll need for this recipe).\nPreheat oven to 300 F. Combine all of the ingredients thoroughly. Form into desired shapes and sizes (we usually form them into crescents) and bake on greased and floured cookie sheets. Bake for 20-30 minutes depending on thickness of cookie. (In my oven, it takes about 24 minutes).\nNOTES :This recipe is a double recipe. These are one of my favorite cookies-I just LOVE almonds!\n",

Rinse in cold water, pat dry with paper towels. Cut the bacon into 1 inch by 1/4 inch pieces.\nBrown bacon on medium high heat in a dutch oven big enough to hold the chicken, about 10 minutes. Remove the cooked bacon, set aside. Keep the bacon fat in the pan. Working in batches if necessary, add onions and chicken, skin side down. Brown the chicken well, on all sides, about 10 minutes. Halfway through the browning, add the garlic and sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper.\nSpoon off any excess fat. Add the chicken stock, wine, and herbs. Add back the bacon. Lower heat to a simmer. Cover and cook for 20 minutes, or until chicken is tender and cooked through. Remove chicken and onions to a separate platter. Remove the bay leaves, herb sprigs, garlic, and discard.\nAdd mushrooms to the remaining liquid and turn the heat to high. Boil quickly and reduce the liquid by three fourths until it becomes thick and saucy. Lower the heat, stir in the butter. Return the chicken and onions to the pan to reheat and coat with sauce. Adjust seasoning. Garnish with parsley and serve with potatoes or egg noodles.\n",

Melt remaining 6 tablespoons butter in a high-sided skillet over medium heat. When butter bubbles, add flour. Cook, stirring, 1 minute.\nSlowly pour hot milk into flour-butter mixture while whisking. Continue cooking, whisking constantly, until the mixture bubbles and becomes thick.\nRemove the pan from the heat. Stir in salt, nutmeg, black pepper, cayenne pepper, 3 cups cheddar, and 1 1/2 cups Gruyere. Set cheese sauce aside.\nFill a large saucepan with water. Bring to a boil. Add macaroni; cook 2 to 3 fewer minutes than manufacturers directions, until outside of pasta is cooked and inside is underdone. (Different brands of macaroni cook at different rates; be sure to read the instructions.) Transfer the macaroni to a colander, rinse under cold running water, and drain well. Stir macaroni into the reserved cheese sauce.\nPour the mixture into the prepared casserole dish. Sprinkle remaining 1 1/2 cups cheddar and 1/2 cup Gruyere; scatter breadcrumbs over the top. Bake until browned on top, about 30 minutes. Transfer dish to a wire rack to cool for 5 minutes; serve.\n",

Cook over low heat for 10 minutes, stirring occassionally.\nIf using basil leaves, add them and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring the basil in and allowing it to wilt.\nWash lettuce leaves and pat dry.\nSpoon a healthy serving of chickpea mixture onto lettuce wraps and serve immediately.

Place each piece on the floured parchment paper and repeat with the rest of the dough.\nBring a large pot of water to boil. Boil half the gnocchi, then remove and repeat. With each batch, boil until all the gnocchi floatsabout 5 minutes.\nMeanwhile, heat another large skillet over medium heat. Add the butter and flour, whisk until smooth.\nThen add the shallots and garlic. Saute for 3 minutes.\nThen add the bourbon and chicken stock.\nWhisk and raise heat. Bring the sauce to a boil. Allow the sauce to reduce down to a thin gravy-like consistency. Then lower the heat to medium-low and add the cream.

        "instructions": "Preheat oven to 400 f. Brush a large baking sheet with a tablespoon of the olive oil. In a large, shallow dish combine the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, garlic powder, salt, pepper and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Toss well with a fork until the oil is completely dispersed into the bread crumbs. Combine the eggs with 1 tablespoon of water in a medium bowl. Place the flour in a large resealable bag.\nAdd half of the cauliflower florets to the bag with the flour, seal and shake to coat well. Remove the cauliflower to a fine mesh strainer and shake to remove excess flour. Place the floured cauliflower on a plate. Repeat with the remaining cauliflower.\nWorking with a few pieces at a time. Add to the beaten egg. Using a fork, turn and toss the florets in the egg to completely coat. Transfer to the breadcrumb mixture and coat, pressing the crumbs into the florets, the help them adhere. Place on the oiled baking sheet, making sure you leave a little space between each florets so they crisp up really well. Repeat this step with the rest of the cauliflower. Spray the tops of the breaded florets lightly with cooking spray. Bake the cauliflower for 20 minutes, Flip the pieces over and continue baking for about 15 more minutes, until the cauliflower is crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside.\nWhile the cauliflower is baking, prepare the marinara. Pulse the undrained tomatoes in a food processor a few times until mostly broken down. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil with the garlic and pepper flakes in a medium saucepan over medium heat until just sizzling. Add the tomatoes and simmer for about 10 minutes until the marinara thickens slightly and the flavors develop. Add 2 tablespoons of the fresh basil, season with salt and pepper if needed.\nWhen the cauliflower is done baking, transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle with the remaining basil. Serve with the marinara.\n",

Gather your fresh herbs, rinse and pat dry.\nSpread a very thin layer of spread on all inside surfaces of bread.\nLayer cucumber on top of the spread. Next, add a layer of mint, dill. You can add both herbs to each sandwich or do half dill and half mint. Grind fresh black pepper inside sandwiches before slicing.\nClose sandwich and slice into quarter cubes or triangles.\nPlate and serve.\nOptional: add a thin layer of spicy sun dried tomato spread or a dash of red pepper flakes for an extra spicy kick of flavor. Another pretty addition would be edible flowers - add inside the sandwiches or as an edible garnish to the serving patter.\n",

        "instructions": "Cake:\nIn a bowl add the cocoa and pour in the boiling water. Stir to combine and let cool.\nIn a large mixing bowl combine the flour, 1 cup sugar, baking powder and salt.\nIn a separate bowl add the 6 egg whites and cream of tartar. With an electric mixer beat the egg whites until soft peaks form, gradually add the 1/3 cup sugar and beat until firm but not dry.\nMake a well in the dry ingredients.\nAdd the oil, egg yolks, vanilla and cooled cocoa. Beat until smooth.\nMix in about a 1/4 of the egg whites to loosen the batter and then fold in the remainder of the egg whites.\nPour into 2-8 inch prepared cake pans and bake at a preheated 350 F oven for 30-35 minutes. The cake is done when a wooden skewer inserted in the center comes out clean.\nFilling:\nWith and electric mixer, blend the sugar, cocoa and butter, add the vanilla and cream. Mix and add more cream to obtain the desired texture.\nTopping:\nIn a double boiler or microwave bring the cream to just below the boiling point. Add the chocolate pieces and butter, and with a wooden spoon stir to blend. Allow to cool, this will thicken the ganache gor the topping.\nAssembly:\nWith a long knife, slice the cakes in the center to  obtain 4 layers in all.  Sprinkle some Kirsch or other favourite liqueur on the first layer of cake and spread a thin layer of the filling. Place raspberry halves on the filling and place a second layer of cake on top. Continue in the same manner until the remaining 2 layer are filled, leaving the top layer to be iced with the ganache topping.\n",

        "instructions": "For the brine, combine the water, salt, sugar, half of the dried herbs and bay leaves into a large saucepan.  Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring to dissolve the salt and sugar.  Reduce to heat to low and simmer for 10 min so the flavors of the herbs can be drawn out. Pour the brine into a deep set large bowl and cool it down with your ice water.  Set aside.\nClean the chicken by rinsing out the cavity and outer skin and place on a clean surface.  Be sure not to contaminate any vegetables or other ingredients, because no one is a fan of salmonella!  Place the chicken in the brine,  make sure it is completely immersed in the brine.  Cover and allow to marinate for at least an hour and up to 6 hours.\nPreheat the oven to 375F.\nRemove the chicken from the brine and place on a clean surface.  Pat the chicken dry with a paper towel as shown.  Separate the skin from the flesh, you can do this by carefully inserting your fingers underneath the skin and gently pull up to create a space or pocket.  Take the butter and rub it underneath the skin and flesh  this will make your chicken moist and tender while accentuating the flavor of the herbs in the meat.  Coat the skin with te remaining herbs and place in a roasting pan, if more herbs are needed just add more.\nBake the chicken for about 1 hour and 10 minutes, basting the chicken half way through and again during the last 10 minutes.  To test the doneness of your chicken, insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the breast, it should read 165F.  If you do not own a thermometer, cut into the chicken and if it releases pink juices it is undercooked.  Your chicken is done when the juices are a clear yellow.\nTransfer the chicken to a carving board and allow it to rest for 10-20 minutes.  This allows the juices to settle into the meat so it does not end up running out all over the board.  To serve, begin carving the legs it is easiest to cut at the joints.  Remove the wings and then the legs and thighs the same way.  To carve each breast, start at the breabone and cut downward and parallel to the rib cage.  Then make a deep horizontal cut right above the thigh and wing joints.  You can choose to serve the breasts whole or cut them into thin slices.\n",

        "instructions": "Bring water and 1 tsp. of salt to boil and stir in rice.  Reduce heat, cover and cook rice until all water is absorbed.  Fluff rice and set aside until it is warm to the touch.  You must work with WARM rice, not cold.\nMix the eggs, cheese and parsley in a small bowl.  Add to the warm rice and stir well until all rice is coated with the egg mixture.\nIn a separate bowl, add the cup of breadcrumbs.  Keeping your hands wet, roll rice mixture into balls the size of a golf ball.  Coat with breadcrumbs.  Repeat until all the rice mixture is used.\nHeat about 1-inch of oil in a heavy skillet, preferably cast iron.  Oil should be about 375 degrees OR when a cube of bread is dropped in the oil, it will brown in 1 minute.\nAdd rice balls to hot oil and brown on all sides.  This may have to be done in stages--do NOT crowd the pan!  Fry maybe 6-8 balls at a time so they have plenty of room to move around in the pan.  When brown, remove to a plate covered with a paper towel to drain oil.  These may be kept warm in a 200 degree oven until all the rice balls are cooked.\nMakes about 24 rice balls.  Serve with marinara sauce and extra cheese.\n",

        "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut the bell peppers lengthwise, remove the seeds and stems.  Lightly oil the bell peppers by tossing them in a bowl with some grapeseed oil or olive oil.  Place the peppers on a baking sheet skin-side down. Roast in the oven for 8-10 minutes until the edges begin to show some color.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool.\nWhile the peppers are roasting, prepare your stuffing.  Place the cream cheese, walnuts, garlic, salt, sriracha and black pepper in a bowl and mix until creamy (I used a fork to mash the ingredients together but Im sure this can be done in a food processor or mixer). Add the green onion and fold in to the cream cheese until combined.  Test the cream cheese for flavor. If you would like, add more salt and/or sriracha.\nHeat your oven to 400 degrees. Use a spoon (or a piping bag) to stuff the peppers liberally and place them back on the baking sheet.  There is enough stuffing here to really pack those suckers up, so you dont need to worry about the amount of cream cheese youre portioning out.  If the cream cheese is very soft, place the baking sheet in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to allow it to set up. If not, place pop the peppers in the oven and bake about 8 minutes.  Change oven setting to high broil and bake an additional 2 minutes, until the tops of the cream cheese begin to brown (If theyre already brown at this point, skip the broiling).\nPut on a pretty plate and serve to your friends.\n",

        "instructions": "In your soup pot, saute over med-high heat: 2 Tbsp of your olive oil with the shallot, onion and jalapeno. When cooked lightly, add in lemon juice, veggie broth, remaining oil, salt and pepper. Reduce heat to medium. Add Potatoes and bring broth to a boil. Cook until potatoes are tender.\nAdd chopped Broccoli (florets and steams). Remember to leave out a few florets for later use though.Cover with lid, when broccoli is tender, turn heat off.\nTransfer contents of pot into a large mixing bowl. Allow to cool slightly. Add to the bowl the fresh parsley, Chobani and almond milk. Fold new ingredients into the hot soup mixture.\nIn batches, puree the soup in a food-processor (maybe someday soon, a Vitamix!) style blender. Soup should be smooth-no lumps or chunks. In the soup pot, add the broccoli florets, a dash of veggie broth and saute covered for about a minute until tender. Add the pureed soup back into the soup pot. Add a bay leaf and a few pinches of chopped basil (optional). Simmer uncovered for at least twenty minutes to cook out all the air bubbles. Stir constantly for the first few minutes. Remove the bay leaf before serving or storing.\n",

Cut it in little pieces, mix with 2 tablespoon of sugar and let sit for at least 1/2 hour. It will extract a lot of water that needs to be drained. Pat rhubarb dry for further use.\nIn a kitchen machine beat together butter, sugar and vanilla extract until the butter is fluffy and the sugar is dissolved. Put in the eggs, one at a time and mix well.\nIn a separate bowl sift together flour, ground almonds, salt and baking powder, add slowly to the egg mixture. Dont over mix.\nFill dough into the spring pan, top with dried rhubarb and bake for 25 min.\nIn the mean time prepare the meringue/ baiser topping. Beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Slowly add the sugar until meringue is firm and shiny.\nSpread the meringue evenly over the rhubarb and decorate with almond slices. Return to the oven for another 15 min. Cover the cake with aluminum foil after 5 min. in case the meringue does turn too dark.\nCool completely before removing the cake from the pan.\n",

Cover, bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 4 minutes. Take off the heat and let stand, covered, for 10 minutes to gently finish cooking the fish. Lift the fish out of the milk with a slotted spoon and put on a plate to cool.\nMeanwhile, cook the potatoes in the salted water for 10 minutes or until tender, but not broken up. Drain the potatoes and leave them for a minute or two.\nTip them back into the hot pan on the lowest heat and let them dry out for 1 minute, mashing them with a fork and stirring so they don't stick. You should have a light, dry fluffy mash. Take off the heat and beat in 1 tablespoon of the sauce, then the lemon zest, parsley, pepper and chives. Set aside.\nDrain off liquid from the fish, then flake it into big chunks into the pan of potatoes. Using your hands, gently lift the fish and potatoes together so they just mix. Do it with only a couple of turns, or the fish will break up too much. Put to aside and cool.\nBeat the egg on a large plate and lightly flour a board. Spread the breadcrumbs on another plate. On the floured board, and with floured hands, carefully shape into 4-6 cakes, about 2.5 cm thick. One by one, put each cake in the egg, and brush over the top and sides so it is completely coated. Transfer each cake to the plate with bread crumbs, pat the crumbs on the sides and tops so they are lightly covered. Transfer to a plate, cover and chill for 30 minutes (or up to a day ahead).\nFry the fish cakes in hot oil over a medium heat for about 5 minutes on each side or until crisp and golden. Serve with the rest of the sauce (squeeze in a little lemon zest to taste) and lemon wedges for squeezing over.\n",

        "instructions": "In a large bowl mix all the dry ingredients together.Work your butter or margarine into the flour till it is well combined.In a separate small bowl, Whisk your egg till it is frothy, add your vanilla and coconut milk.In the bowl with the dry ingredients, make a well in the centre and slowly add your egg mix, combining the flour with the mix as you add it.Mix the entire dough till its no longer sticky and everything is combined then cover the dough in a plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 30-45 minutes.Sprinkle some flour on the surface you would use to roll out the chin chin dough.Cut a small chunk of the dough and with a rolling pin, roll out the chin chin dough. If you want larger chin chin chunks, do not roll it out so thin, If you want regular sized chin chin, roll it out so its relatively thin but not all the way.With a knife, cut the chin chin to your desired shape and set aside.In a pan of hot oil for deep frying, place your chin chin dough and allow to fry till its golden brown. Place in a paper towel to allow the excess oil to be absorbed and for it to cool down.If using an oven, pre-heat the oven to 370 F and place the chin chin dough on a lined foil container and bake for about 30-35 minutes or until browned.If you want it sweeter, sprinkle some powdered sugar on the top or add more sugar to the initial recipe.P.s: This is more of an in between recipe, its not completely soft. If you want it extra soft, you can use 2cups of flour.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

        "instructions": "Using a vegetable peeler, remove wide, long strips of potato peel and set aside. Finish peeling the potatoes. ( I had probably around a 1 1/2 c. peels.)\nHeat a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add chopped bacon and cook until crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon to a paper towel-lined plate.\nTo the fat in the pan, add the potato skins and cook until crisp about 10 min. (You want to be sure they are crisp, or else they'll just be soggy and greasy, I took mine out at just the 10 minute mark and they weren't truly crisp, so I just spread them out on a cookie sheet and baked them in a 400 degree oven for around 5 minutes and they were very crisp after that.)\nRemove the crisped potato skins to the paper-lined plate with the bacon. Add the onion to the fat remaining in the pan, cook until tender and lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Add the thyme and flour, cook and stir for about a minute. Slowly whisk in the chicken broth and the half n half. Add the potatoes and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and cook until the potatoes are very tender, (you should be able to easly crush a piece of potato against the side of the pot with the back of a wooden spoon) about 10-15 minutes.\nUsing a blender, puree (in small batches) all but about 3 cups of the soup. Using a potato masher or your wooden spoon, lightly crush the potato chunks in the reserved potion of the soup. Add the pureed soup back to the pot and return to a low burner to keep the soup hot. Add in the 2 c. cheese, stir until melted, then add in the sour cream, stir well. Season to taste with salt & pepper. (Sometimes I like to add some of the crisped bacon into the soup mixture at this point, but that's optional.)\nTo serve, top bowls of soup with crisped bacon and potato skins, additional cheddar, sour cream and sliced scallion.\n",

Take the chicken and roll it into the flour, using your fingers to assist in adhering it to the meat. Carefully shake off excess flour. Repeat with second piece of chicken.\nIn a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Slide chicken into the skillet and saute on each side until it becomes golden brown, about 3-4 minutes each side. Once chicken is done, transfer to a clean plate and tent with a sheet of aluminum foil.\nBegin boiling the pasta.\nUsing the same skillet, add remaining olive oil and saute garlic until it becomes aromatic but not browned. \nAdd chili flakes, capers, lemon juice, lemon slices, zest, and chicken broth. \nUse a wooden spoon to scrape off the tasty brown bits from the bottom of the skillet. \nRaise the temperature to medium high heat and allow the liquid to reduce by almost half. \nWhile the liquid is reducing, use a fork to mash together remaining 1 tablespoon of flour and butter in a small bowl.  Whisk it into the reducing liquid and allow to cook for 1-2 minutes. Be sure to whisk out any lumps of flour. Check for seasonings and adjust with salt/pepper accordingly.\nDrain the cooked pasta. \nToss the pasta in the lemon caper sauce, tomatoes, and basil, reserving a few spoonfuls of sauce. Check for seasonings and adjust with salt/pepper accordingly.\n Plate pasta and top each with a piece of chicken. Spoon extra lemon caper sauce over the chicken and pasta. Serve immediately.\n",

Then cut the lemons in half crossways, giving you little lemon bowls.\nUsing a small knife, remove the lemon flesh, leaving you with 4 hollow lemon rind bowls. (Again you dont want to break-into the rind)\nCut a piece of mozzarella to fit inside, then lay a basil leaf, half an anchovy fillet and half a cherry tomato on top with a pinch of salt &amp; pepper and a little drizzle of good olive oil. Put another slice of mozzarella on top - the lemon should now be filled up. Do the same to the rest of the lemon bowls.\nPlace on a baking sheet &amp; cook in a preheated oven for 10 - 15 minutes, until golden &amp; bubbling.\nRemove from the oven and serve immediately. To eat: scoop the mozzarella out and eat with the bread to soak up any juices!\n",

If you're using frozen vegetables, follow the package cooking instructions, but stop shy of three minutes of cooking time so they don't get mushy.\nIn large pan or wok, heat your sesame oil over medium heat. Throw in the garlic and ginger and fry that up for about a minute. Add the carrots and stir quickly for a minute or two. Then add the rice.\nNow add soy sauce based on your saltiness preference.\nLet that sizzle while you whip your egg in a small bowl. Move your rice to the edges of the pan so you have an empty space in the middle. Add the egg and scramble it up. When it looks close to being cooked, stir the rice back into the middle of the pan.\nNext, throw in the broccoli and peas or other blanched vegetables of your choice. Add the sugar and stir for a couple minutes, then add the butter. Once the butter is melted through, let the rice sit there. Let it sizzle a bit.\nThat's it! Serve your fried rice.\n",

If you don't have one, you can use an 8x8, 9x9, or if neceessary an 11x13.\nPlace peanut butter and butter in a microwave safe dish. Heat in the microwave for 30-45 seconds or until butter is melted. Stir together.\nPlace all ingredients, except fruit, into a bowl. Using an electric beater or KitchenAid mixer, beat ingredients together for approximately 1 minutes.\nPeel a whole apple and thinly chop into pinky nail size pieces.\nStir the apples into the oatmeal mixture.\nPour the mixture into greased pan and press entire mixture down firmly with your fingers.\nPlace pan into the oven and cook for 25 minutes or until edges are golden brown. If you are using an 11x13 pan, it will take a bit less time because the mixture will be much thinner.\nLet cool for 10 minutes before slicing into strips. Let the remaining bars cool entirely before you place in tupperware or wrap them in foil.\n",

If you will be using a cookie sheet, line it with parchment paper and set it aside.\nWhisk together the flours, baking powder, 3 TB of the sugar, and salt in a medium bowl.\nCut in the butter using a pastry blender, two knives, or your fingers, until the largest chunks of butter are the size of small peas.\nPour in the cream and milk (or just use all cream, if you have it) and mix it around with a fork until an evenly hydrated, extremely sticky dough forms.\nAdd the fruits and mix again until evenly distributed (you may have to work a bit to break up the ginger pieces).\nDump the sticky mass out onto a well-floured board.  Sprinkle a little flour on top as well, then pat the dough out into a circle about 1-inch thick.  Try not to add too much flour, lest they become dense and tough.  Dip a pizza cutter or other thin, sharp knife into flour, then cut the circle into 8 equal sized pieces.  You may need to scrape off and re-flour your slicing instrument between slices.\nUsing a bench scraper, a thin spatula, or (if you are brave) your hands, relocate your 8 scones to your prepared baking vessel, spacing them a half inch or so apart (they will puff and rise a little bit, but not tremendously).  Sprinkle the tops with the remaining 1 TB of sugar.\nBake for 13-15 minutes, or until lightly golden on top and cooked through.\nCool at least 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack.  Eat warm or cool.\n",

Using a spoon, dollop lines of jam across the batter and swirl into batter using a knife. Pour the rest of the batter on top.\nMix up the crumble topping: add the walnuts to a bag and crush until broken down into pea-sized crumbs. Toss with the oat flour, cinnamon, sugar and rolled oats if using. Stir in the tablespoon of oil until the everything starts to come together--mixture should be crumbly. Sprinkle the topping evenly across the top of the batter and bake for 25 minutes, or until browned on top and it springs back slightly when touched. Serve warm.\n",

In a large mixing bowl add soften cream cheese and sugar/cocoa mix. Beat with an electric mixer until smooth, add melted chocolate, heavy cream and sour cream, beat until combined. Add eggs, one at a time and mix well after each, then add in vanilla. Tap the bowl on the counter firmly a couple of times to release any air bubbles.\n3. Divide batter between the cupcake liners (liners will be full). Tap the pan a couple of times to be sure there are no large air bubble. Bake for 15-20 minutes, until the centers jiggle just slightly. (Original recipe called for baking time of 17-20 minutes, mine were done at the 15 minute mark.) Remove pan from oven, let cool at room temp. for 1 hour. Cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours or until fully cooled before topping.\n4. Top the cheesecakes: In a medium bowl whisk together heavy cream, powdered sugar and vanilla. Place the bowl in the refrigerator, along with the beaters from your mixer, for 10-15 minutes to get everything well chilled. Add gelatin to a small bowl, add water. When gelatin absorbs all the water microwave for about 10 seconds to heat and melt the gelatin and make it pourable. Set aside to cool a bit. Beat the cream until just before it reaches soft peak stage, check your gelatin to be sure it has cooled slightly but is still a pourable consistency (if it solidified, just pop it back in the microwave for a couple seconds). With the mixer running, slowly pour in the gelatin and finish whipping the cream to soft peak stage.\n5. Top the cakes with a generous spoon full of the whipped cream, using the back of a spoon make a little nest indentation in the top for the cherry filling. Add a spoon full of the cherry filling and you're done.\n",

Add the vanilla bean and vanilla bean caviar to the mixture.  Cover and let steep for 1 hour.\nIn a small saute pan, melt the butter, brown sugar and salt.  Bring to a boil stirring constantly until the mixture turns a deep golden brown.  Add the bananas and continue to saute the mixture for approximately 5 more minutes or until the bananas soften.  Stir in the rum and remove from heat.  Let the mixture cool to room temperature.\nFill a large bowl with ice and water.  Place a small bowl in the ice water and add the heavy cream.  Top the small bowl with a wire strainer and set aside.\nIn a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and remaining 1/4 cup sugar until light in color and ribbons begin to form.\nReheat the milk mixture over med-low heat and slowly add to egg mixture whisking constantly so the eggs do not scramble.  Return the milk/egg mixture to the pan and heat. Stir constantly with a heat resistant spatula being sure to scrape the sides and bottom until it begins to thicken (it will coat the back of the spatula).\nStrain the milk mixture into the cream, remove the strainer and stir until combined.  Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours or overnight.\nPour the mixture into the freezer can of an electric ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturers instructions.  When the mixture reaches soft serve consistency, add the banana mixture and continue churning until combined.\nTransfer the ice cream to a freezer safe container and freeze.\n",

Add the onions along with the garlic and chilli flakes and cook on high until the onion caramelise (about ten minutes).\nNow add the mushrooms and continue to cook on high so the mushrooms caramelise as well, about five minutes. Take off the fire, add the thyme and salt and pepper to taste.\nBeat the eggs in a large bowl with the cream and half the quantity of cheese. Add the onion-mushroom mixture and mix well.\nPlace the pie shell on a cookie tray to catch any spillage. Pour the filling into the pie shell. Top the quiche with the remaining cheese.\nDrop the temperature to 375F and cook until the filling is set and golden. Serve when still warm from the oven.\n",

The chicken stock if freshly made will have some oil from the chicken so your rice does not need oil.Increase the heat and stir in the chopped vegetables and pepper. Add your seasoning cube.Finally stir in your cubed mango and serve warm with any protein of your choice. I\u2019d say chicken but it\u2019s up to you.",

Line a rimmed baking sheet with a Silpat or parchment paper.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the egg whites, vanilla bean paste, and cream of tartar until soft peaks begin to form.\nSift together the sugar, cocoa powder, and cornstarch. With the motor running at low speed, add the sugar mixture 1 tablespoon at a time to the egg whites. Add the vinegar and dark chocolate. Whip until fully incorporated and the egg whites hold a stiff peak (the whip attachment will have a sturdy egg white tail when removed).\nScoop the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Shape into a 9- to 10-inch circle with a slightly higher edge. Bake until the outside is dry and starting to crack slightly, 1 to 1 hours. Turn the heat off and leave the meringue in the oven to cool, about 1 hour.\nTo make the whipped cream: Add the cream, confectioners sugar, and vanilla to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment.\nWhip until the cream holds soft peaks.\nTo assemble: Place the baked meringue onto a serving platter or cake stand. Spread the whipped cream in the center leaving a 2-inch gap around the edge.\nArrange the fruit on top and serve immediately.\n",

You could use warm water so the sugar dissolves better.Pour the sugar mix into the watermelon juice, add the angostura bitters and grenadine.Use one of the lemon slices to rub around the tip of the glass and rub the glass in the sprinkles or sugar for garnishing.Pour some ice cubes in your glass and pour in the watermelon juice and serve cold.

Put mixture in a large bowl.\nIn a separate mixing bowl, beat egg white and caster sugar until semi-firm peaks form to make soft meringue.\nUse a whisk to mix 1/3 soft meringue with mixture.\nGently fold in the rest with spatula.\nPour mixture into cake tin and steam bake for about 50 mins at the lower rack of the oven.\nMove the cheesecake to upper rack of the oven and switch temperature to grill for about 30 seconds to one minute to get a nice golden colour on top of the cake.\nLeave cheesecake to cool in room temperature, remove and best to chill before serve.\n",

        "instructions": "Make the salsa: In a small bowl, combine all the salsa ingredients, season with salt &amp; pepper (pepper is optional). Set aside while preparing everything else.\nStart the rice: Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and 1/2 t. salt. Cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the rice and coconut and saute about 3 minutes, until rice starts to become translucent at the edges. Add the water, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and cover. Cook about 15 minutes, until the water is absorbed and rice is tender. Remove pan from heat and let sit, covered for 10 minutes. Gently fluff the rice with a fork. Add the cilantro and lime juice and pepper to taste.\nMake the fish: Meanwhile, pat the fish fillets dry and season with salt and pepper. In one dish place the flour, in another dish, beat the eggs and 1 T. water until mixed, and in another mix together the coconut and panko. Working with one fillet at a time, dredge fish in the flour, then pat off the excess, dip in the egg, letting any excess drip back into the bowl, then coat in the coconut-panko mix, pressing the coating onto the fish to be sure it adheres.\nHeat the oven to 200 degrees f. (to keep the fish warm between batches). Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until the oil shimmers and just starts to near the smoking point. Add 2 of the fillets and cook about 3 minutes per side, until the fish is golden and cooked through. Drain briefly on paper towels and place in the warm oven while cooking the remaining fish. Serve the fish and rice with the mango salsa and lime wedges.\n",

You will grill your chicken 8  10 minutes on each side.While your chicken is grilling, go ahead and get your additional ingredients ready to place on the chicken. Place your Balsamic vinegar in a small pan to also go on the grill.Open the grill after chicken has cooked and place the mozzarella slice, basil leaf, and then tomato slice on each chicken breast. Place the pan with Balsamic vinegar on the grill to the side to heat up as well. After 2 minutes, drizzle the bubbling vinegar over the chicken breasts and then cook for an additional 2 minutes.Remove the chicken breasts from the grill and serve warm with a side of potatoes and a salad.",

        "instructions": "Pre-heat the oven to 200 deg Celsius.\nLay a sheet of baking paper on a baking tray and grease it lightly with olive oil. Lay the whole fish fillet on the baking sheet and rub the fish generously with the rest of the olive oil.\nSeason with salt and pepper. I like to use Masterfoods Garlic Pepper whenever a recipe calls for salt and pepper.\nPlace the fish in an oven pre-heated to 200 deg Celsius for 15-20 minutes until fish is cooked. Do not overcook the fish. The standard, fan-forced or grill functions of the oven may be used.\nWhile the fish is cooking, lightly peel a piece of cucumber. About 150g large. Leave some skin on for a prettier appearance. Cut the cucumber into strips and trim off the seeds. Retain the crunchy parts. Dice the cucumber strips. Set aside the cucumber dices in a bowl.\nUse only sun-dried tomatoes that are soaked in oil. Remove the tomatoes from the jar and drain the excess oil. Cut the tomatoes into small pieces. Add the tomatoes to the cucumber.\nStack 5 leaves of mint or basil together. Roll up the stack of leaves. Using a pair of kitchen scissors, cut the herbs into fine strips. Add them to the tomato mixture.\nAdd salt and pepper to taste, 1/2 teaspoon of sugar, 1 teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon of balsamic vinegar and 1 teaspoon of toasted sesame seeds. Stir the tomato relish mixture well to combine.\nRemove the fish from the oven. Cut into servicing portions and place the relish on the top of the each fish fillet.\nGarnish with sprigs of mint or basil.\n",

When the mixture is hot, add the asparagus pieces and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring. Add the garlic and cook for about a minute. Spread the asparagus so it is evenly distributed across the bottom of the pan.\nAdd the egg mixture to the pan and allow the eggs to cook without mixing them. Use a rubber spatula to run around the edges of the frittata as it cooks so the edges dont stick and burn. After 1-2 minutes, add the cheese evenly to the egg mixture.\nWhen the outer edges of the frittata have set but the center is still slightly runny, arrange the cherry tomatoes and asparagus spears on the top of the frittata, sprinkle the remaining thyme over the top, then remove the pan from the heat and place it in an oven set to broil.\nThe broiler will allow the top portion of the egg mixture to set and cook thoroughly. Keep a close watch so the frittata doesnt burn.\nAfter a few minutes, when the eggs have set completely and begin to turn golden, carefully remove the pan from the oven.\nUse a rubber spatula to run around the edges and underside of the frittata, and slide it onto a round serving plate.\nSlice and serve warm or at room temperature.\n",

        "instructions": "With this recipe you play with the amount of ingredients based on your likes & the strength of the garlic, arugula, etc.\nBest to use a mortar & pestle but if you dont have one the food processor works just fine.\nIn the mortal & pestle or the processor start off with your arugula and a drizzle of oil to get it working. Once pulverized add in 1 clove of garlic & continue to grind. Now add in your nuts, lemon juice and a bit of salt & pepper & give it one more grind. At this point abandon the mortal & pestle or the machine & dump the mixture into a bowl.\nAdd a small handful of cheese and while continuously mixing add in the olive oil until you achieve your desired consistency. For crostini I would leave as a paste, for a pasta sauce keep it a bit looser - this is all based on the amount of olive oil you use.\nNow recheck your seasonings - more garlic? A little light on the acid? Add a squeeze of lemon. Is it flat? A pinch of salt will wake it up. Let sit for an hour or so to let the flavors incorporate. Store in the fridge. It will last a few days before the arugula will turn.\nServe tossed over fresh pasta or rubbed over toasty bread with a ribbon of parmesan, a delicious topping for pizza or a beautiful frittata with a dollop of arugula pesto! There are a million ways to use this - enjoy!\n",

Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 40 to 60 minutes. Take care not to overcook  the beans should be tender but not be falling apart. Drain and set aside.To prepare the eggplant, cut of the stem and bottom edge and then cut in half lengthwise. Score the flesh into diagonal 1-inch lines, then turn and score again until you have a diagonal pattern. Take care not to cut through the skin. Sprinkle with some salt and let sit for 40 minutes. Rinse and squeeze out any excess water. Brush the eggplant with some oil and transfer to a roasting pan. Bake in a preheated 400 oven until the flesh appears collapsed and is wrinkly. Remove from heat and let cool for about 10 minutes, season with a bit of salt, and remove the flesh from the eggplant. If there is too much water, drain in a strainer. Set aside.Heat the oil over medium heat in the same saucepan used to cook the black-eyed peas. When hot, toss in the shallots and chilies and saut for 2 to 3 minutes. Now add the spices and stir for another minute, until fragrant. Add the tomato, cook for another few minutes, and then add the eggplant and black-eyed peas, and cook for another few minutes, stirring often.Pour a few tablespoons of water into the pan and add handfuls of chard at a time until wilted. Add more water as necessary. Add the lemon juice and salt to taste near the end of the cooking time. Remove from heat, cover, and let sit for a few minutes before serving.",

To a second shallow bowl, add the egg wash (2 eggs mixed with 1 tablespoon of water); and to a third shallow bowl, combine the bread crumbs, salt, garlic powder and cayenne pepper.Dredge the chicken strips in the flour, shaking to get rid of any excess. Transfer to the egg wash and fully coat. Finally, place the chicken strips in the panko bread crumb mixture and press to adhere where necessary. Place the chicken strips on the prepared baking sheet and spray generously with a non-stick spray. Bake for 20-22 minutes or until crispy, brown and cooked through.While the chicken is cooking, prepare your sauce. In a medium saucepan, whisk together the brown sugar, cayenne pepper sauce and butter. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, and then remove from heat.Once the chicken has cooked, toss it in the sauce. Serve immediately with ranch. Enjoy!",

        "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut the bell peppers lengthwise, remove the seeds and stems.  Lightly oil the bell peppers by tossing them in a bowl with some grapeseed oil or olive oil.  Place the peppers on a baking sheet skin-side down. Roast in the oven for 8-10 minutes until the edges begin to show some color.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool.\nWhile the peppers are roasting, prepare your stuffing.  Place the cream cheese, walnuts, garlic, salt, sriracha and black pepper in a bowl and mix until creamy (I used a fork to mash the ingredients together but Im sure this can be done in a food processor or mixer). Add the green onion and fold in to the cream cheese until combined.  Test the cream cheese for flavor. If you would like, add more salt and/or sriracha.\nHeat your oven to 400 degrees. Use a spoon (or a piping bag) to stuff the peppers liberally and place them back on the baking sheet.  There is enough stuffing here to really pack those suckers up, so you dont need to worry about the amount of cream cheese youre portioning out.  If the cream cheese is very soft, place the baking sheet in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to allow it to set up. If not, place pop the peppers in the oven and bake about 8 minutes.  Change oven setting to high broil and bake an additional 2 minutes, until the tops of the cream cheese begin to brown (If theyre already brown at this point, skip the broiling).\nPut on a pretty plate and serve to your friends.\n",

Use a food processor to chop them to the finest size possible. (A 2-pound bag of almonds is what you'll need for this recipe).\nPreheat oven to 300 F. Combine all of the ingredients thoroughly. Form into desired shapes and sizes (we usually form them into crescents) and bake on greased and floured cookie sheets. Bake for 20-30 minutes depending on thickness of cookie. (In my oven, it takes about 24 minutes).\nNOTES :This recipe is a double recipe. These are one of my favorite cookies-I just LOVE almonds!\n",

Bring the mixture almost to a boil.\nPut the pan on low heat, add the chocolate, and whisk until the chocolate starts to melt. Combine the cornstarch and water to form a slurry. Add the slurry a little at a time, whisking constantly, until the soup is thick and smooth. You will know it is ready when the bubbles are gone and the chocolate has thickened, about 5 to 7 minutes. Carefully pour into two bowls and garnish.\nTopping: Microwave the cream cheese at 10 second intervals or until it can be stirred smooth. Add marshmallow creme to the cream cheese and mix well. Dollop on top of soup, or transfer mixture to pastry bag and pipe design.\n",

        "instructions": "Directions:\nFirst, make the cookie dough. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder and salt. In a large bowl, cream together butter, sugar and brown sugar until light. Beat in egg, milk and vanilla extract. With the mixer on low speed or by hand, blend in the flour mixture, stirring only until no streaks of flour remain. Stir in chocolate chips.\nDivide dough into two equal parts. Place each on a sheet of wax or parchment paper and shape into a log. Wrap in paper and chill logs for 1-2 hours, until firm.\nMake the filling by combining all ingredients in a medium bowl and mix at medium-high speed until smooth. Set aside.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nRemove dough logs from the fridge. Using a sharp knife, divide each log into eight even slices (total of 16 big slices of cookie dough).\nWorking with one piece of cookie dough at a time, flatten the dough into a 3-4 inch wide dish between your palms. Place about 1 tablespoon cream cheese filling in the center of the dough, then pinch the side of the dough together to seal. Work carefully so all the filling is sealed inside.\nPlace on the baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough.\nBake for 15-18 minutes, until cookies are golden brown around the edges. Cool on the baking sheet for 2-3 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.\nMakes 16 gut busting cookies.\n",

If you do not have a stand mixer or a paddle attachment a hand beater will work as well, but will take twice as long to achieve a smooth consistency.\nAdd cream cheese mixture to heavy cream and beat until incorporated.\nGently fold in crushed Oreo cookies.\nFill chosen pan with a slight mound at the center, as the cheesecake will become slightly sunken at the center.\nRefrigerate for at least 6 hours to set or overnight for best results.\nRemove from refrigerator and smooth top to level with edges. Serve with whipping cream and garnish with mini Oreos.\n",

Sift the dry ingredients into a medium bowl and set aside.\nUse an electric mixer to cream the brown sugar, butter, egg and vanilla. Once smooth, slowly add the dry mixture to the wet until well combined. Stir in the oats.\nUse a tablespoon-sized scoop to form equal dough balls. Allow them plenty of space to spread. Bake for 7-9 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool completely before moving off the parchment paper.\nCream the shortening, powdered sugar, and vanilla together until smooth. Mix in the marshmallow fluff.\nTo assemble: Match up two cookies that are of equal size and shape. Turn the bottom cookies over. Use a piping bag (or zip-bag with the corner cut off) to pipe the filling onto the bottom cookie. This is much easier than trying to spread it. Then add the top cookie of each cream pie and press down.\nI found I liked a thin layer of cream filling better than a thick layer--but you should have plenty if you want to pile it on!\nMakes approximately 10 cream pies. (20 cookies)\n",

        "instructions": "Preheat oven to 375F with the rack in middle position.\nMake the Scone Mix.\nUsing a Food Processor fitted with a steel knife blade: Place half the butter and half the dry ingredients in the bowl. Pulse until the butter is reduced to pea-sized pieces, with dough still dry. Transfer first half of the mix into a large bowl. Repeat process with the other half of the ingredients and add to the large bowl.\nBy hand: Place all the ingredients in a large bowl and use a pastry cutter to incorporate the butter into the dough. Cut by pressing on butter, then gathering flour onto it in two quick strokes.  Cut until butter slices become pea-sized.\nDont over process or mix. Dough will be dry. Break large lumps of butter by hand, and toss dry dough with your fingers.\nBlend the cheeses, dill, shallot and pepper with the Scone Mix using a wooden spoon. Drizzle the buttermilk over the dough and drop the cottage cheese in the middle, and stir until mixed. Add more buttermilk if dough is too dry to hold together.\nPlace dough on a lightly floured surface and divide into two. Form 2 discs and flatten each to a thickness of about 1-1/2 inches, cut into 6 wedges for a total of 12. Arrange an inch apart on a cookie sheet.\nBake for 15 minutes, rotate the pan, and bake another 10 to 15 minutes, until scones are light brown on top and darker at the bottom. Bread should no longer be soft and doughy in the center. Bake in 2 batches if scones dont fit in one cookie sheet.\nServe warm or cool in a wire rack before wrapping in foil or plastic wrap/bag. Freshly baked scones can be kept at room temperature for up to 2 days, and in the refrigerator for a week.\n",

        "instructions": "Starting with cake, cream butter and sugars until smooth. Add eggs and vanilla.\nPour into chocolate and mix well.\nSift together flour, baking soda and salt. Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients alternately with buttermilk.\nStir coffee into boiling water until combined, then pour into cake batter and stir until smooth.\nSpray two 9-inch cake pans with floured baking spray. Dust with cocoa. Evenly spread cake batter between both pans.  Bang lightly on the counter to settle batter.\nBake for 30 minutes, or until tester comes out clean, in a preheated oven at 350 degrees. Let cakes cool on a rack for at least an hour.\nAs cakes cool, move on to hazelnut pastry cream. Pour whipping cream in a sauce pan and scald (heat just before boiling).\nIn a separate bowl, whisk egg yolks with sugar. Add flour and cornstarch. Whisk until smooth.\nUse a ladle to scoop about a cup of the hot cream into the eggy sugar. Whisk immediately and quickly to combine.\nPour remaining cream in with eggs and keep stirring. Return warm mixture to sauce pan.\nContinue to cook, whisking all the while, until thick.\nPour into a heat safe bowl and whisk in vanilla and Frangelico until smooth and creamy. Cover with plastic wrap directly touching the cream so a film will not form. Let the cream sit until its reached room temperature. Cool completely in fridge.*  Stir hazelnuts into cream once cold.\nLevel off both cooled cakes and slice each one in half, so there are four layers.\nLay down one cake layer and smooth about a third of the hazelnut cream on top, spreading to about 1/2 inch from edge. Repeat with next two layers and top with last layer.  Place cake in fridge to set while you make the frosting.\nFor the frosting, whisk all of the ingredients in a medium sized heat resistant bowl. Place bowl on top of a slightly larger pot with 1-2 inches of hot, simmering water.  (Do not let water level reach the bottom part of the bowl.)\nWith an electric mixer, beat egg white mixture for six minutes.  Remove from heat and continue beating for another minute while adding the vanilla.\nAllow frosting to cool slightly (we put it in the fridge for about 10 minutes) before frosting cake.  Top with extra hazelnuts.\nYou can make the pastry cream 1-2 days ahead of time, which is exactly what we did.  Do not stir in the hazelnuts until right before you plan to use it.\n",

If you do not have a stand mixer or a paddle attachment a hand beater will work as well, but will take twice as long to achieve a smooth consistency.\nAdd cream cheese mixture to heavy cream and beat until incorporated.\nGently fold in crushed Oreo cookies.\nFill chosen pan with a slight mound at the center, as the cheesecake will become slightly sunken at the center.\nRefrigerate for at least 6 hours to set or overnight for best results.\nRemove from refrigerator and smooth top to level with edges. Serve with whipping cream and garnish with mini Oreos.\n",

        "instructions": "Mix all the sauce ingredients together. Set aside.\nLay the fish and bay leaves in a frying pan. Pour over the milk and water. Cover, bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 4 minutes. Take off the heat and let stand, covered, for 10 minutes to gently finish cooking the fish. Lift the fish out of the milk with a slotted spoon and put on a plate to cool.\nMeanwhile, cook the potatoes in the salted water for 10 minutes or until tender, but not broken up. Drain the potatoes and leave them for a minute or two.\nTip them back into the hot pan on the lowest heat and let them dry out for 1 minute, mashing them with a fork and stirring so they don't stick. You should have a light, dry fluffy mash. Take off the heat and beat in 1 tablespoon of the sauce, then the lemon zest, parsley, pepper and chives. Set aside.\nDrain off liquid from the fish, then flake it into big chunks into the pan of potatoes. Using your hands, gently lift the fish and potatoes together so they just mix. Do it with only a couple of turns, or the fish will break up too much. Put to aside and cool.\nBeat the egg on a large plate and lightly flour a board. Spread the breadcrumbs on another plate. On the floured board, and with floured hands, carefully shape into 4-6 cakes, about 2.5 cm thick. One by one, put each cake in the egg, and brush over the top and sides so it is completely coated. Transfer each cake to the plate with bread crumbs, pat the crumbs on the sides and tops so they are lightly covered. Transfer to a plate, cover and chill for 30 minutes (or up to a day ahead).\nFry the fish cakes in hot oil over a medium heat for about 5 minutes on each side or until crisp and golden. Serve with the rest of the sauce (squeeze in a little lemon zest to taste) and lemon wedges for squeezing over.\n",

Remove any old hard out leaves.\nBring 4 cups of water to the boil and add 1/2 teaspoon of salt.\nAdd the brussel sprouts to the boiling water and leave to boil at medium heat for 4 minutes or until sprouts are tender but still crunchy.\nDrain the brussel sprouts.\nReturn the saucepan to the hot stove and add 1 tablespoon of butter.\nWhile the butter is melting, cut the brussel sprouts in half.\nAdd 1 tablespoon of minced garlic to the melted butter. Saut for a few seconds till garlic is fragrant but not brown.\nReturn the cut brussel sprouts to the saucepan. Toss the brussel sprouts lightly in the garlic-butter sauce.\nAdd 1 tablespoon of bacon bits. I keep a jar of ready to use bacon bits in the fridge at all times for this dish (and for my Mushroom Delight dish). You can also use freshly pan fried and crumbled bacon, but I like to cook this fast.\nSeason to taste with salt and pepper. I always use Masterfoods Garlic Pepper to season my dishes. A few shakes of this and its done.\nAdd a squeeze of fresh lemon juice (about 1 teaspoon).\nToss everything together. Serve with some fresh lemons on the side for extra tangy flavour, if preferred. You can also garnish with some toasted almond flakes.\n",

        "instructions": "Prepare the graham crust: Preheat the oven to 350.\nPut the graham crackers into a food processor and pulse until the crackers break down to the consistency of sand. Transfer to a large bowl. Stir in the salt and melted butter and mix until the butter has thoroughly incorporated; it should be the consistency of wet sand.\nPress and pack the wet graham mixture into six buttered 4 -inch tart pans, making sure it goes up all the way on the sides and that the crust is thick and sturdy.\nArrange the tarts on 1 or 2 cookie sheets and bake for 12 minutes, or until the crusts are golden, but not browned. Remove the tart shells from the oven and set aside to cool.\nIf you are not using spring form pans, carefully remove the crusts from the pans at this stage and follow the recipe as follows.\nThe tart crusts can be stored in airtight plastic containers, in a single layer, for up to 24 hours.\nPrepare the lime curd: Put the lime juice, sugar, eggs, and yolks in a stainless steel bowl and whisk well.\nFill a saucepan halfway with water, and bring the water to a boil over high heat, then lower the heat so the water is simmering. Set the bowl over the pot and whisk the lime mixture occasionally until it thickens, approximately 10 minutes. Then whisk in the butter, 1 piece at a time. When all of the butter is melted and incorporated, stir in the lime zest and remove the saucepan from the heat.\nRemove the bowl from the saucepan and let it cool for 5 minutes.\nTransfer the mixture to a blender or food processor, and blend until very smooth. You can also use an immersion/hand blender instead, if you have one.\nThe mixture can be made, cooled, covered, and refrigerated for up to 1 week.\nDivide the mixture among the tart shells, leaving about half of space on the top for the chocolate ganache layer. Chill in the refrigerator while making the chocolate ganache, or until set.\nPrepare the chocolate ganache: Over a double boiler (simmer water over low heat in a saucepan and put a heat-resistant bowl on top), melt the chocolate together with the sugar and butter. Stir constantly until the sugar is well incorporated and the mixture is smooth and shiny.\nRemove the melted chocolate from the heat and let it cool for 5 minutes.\nCarefully, pour the liquid chocolate ganache over each tartlet, making sure that the chocolate does not over-flow the graham crust sides. Return the tarts to the refrigerator and chill for 1 to 2 hours, or until the ganache has set. (The ganache on top should take on a smooth matte finish.)\nPrepare the meringue and finish the tarts: In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a whip attachment, whip the reserved egg whites until frothy. Slowly add the sugar, then the cream of tartar, continuing to whip until well incorporated. Increase the stand mixer to medium speed and whip until the whites are shiny and form a stiff peak. Do not over-whip or they will become grainy.\nTransfer the meringue into a pastry bag fitted with a star tip, and pipe it around the edge of each tart. Or, transfer it into a large freezer bag, seal tightly, and snip off one corner. Pipe the meringue on as desired.\nUsing a brulee torch, quickly brown the meringue, being careful not to melt the chocolate ganache on top. (Due to the chocolate ganache layer, the meringues should not be browned under a broiler.)\n",

In a large, shallow dish combine the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, garlic powder, salt, pepper and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Toss well with a fork until the oil is completely dispersed into the bread crumbs. Combine the eggs with 1 tablespoon of water in a medium bowl. Place the flour in a large resealable bag.\nAdd half of the cauliflower florets to the bag with the flour, seal and shake to coat well. Remove the cauliflower to a fine mesh strainer and shake to remove excess flour. Place the floured cauliflower on a plate. Repeat with the remaining cauliflower.\nWorking with a few pieces at a time. Add to the beaten egg. Using a fork, turn and toss the florets in the egg to completely coat. Transfer to the breadcrumb mixture and coat, pressing the crumbs into the florets, the help them adhere. Place on the oiled baking sheet, making sure you leave a little space between each florets so they crisp up really well. Repeat this step with the rest of the cauliflower. Spray the tops of the breaded florets lightly with cooking spray. Bake the cauliflower for 20 minutes, Flip the pieces over and continue baking for about 15 more minutes, until the cauliflower is crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside.\nWhile the cauliflower is baking, prepare the marinara. Pulse the undrained tomatoes in a food processor a few times until mostly broken down. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil with the garlic and pepper flakes in a medium saucepan over medium heat until just sizzling. Add the tomatoes and simmer for about 10 minutes until the marinara thickens slightly and the flavors develop. Add 2 tablespoons of the fresh basil, season with salt and pepper if needed.\nWhen the cauliflower is done baking, transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle with the remaining basil. Serve with the marinara.\n",

For better results use medium size eggs.\nIf you intend to prepare this for a party, I suggest you buy several cubers, this way you can boil and chill several eggs at a time, or it will take you a lot of time.\nTo prepare hard boiled eggs, place eggs in a saucepan, cover with cold water and bring to a boil over medium heat. As soon as the water comes to a full boil, let the eggs boil for 5 minutes, and then remove from heat and let stand covered in hot water 10 minutes .\nFilling is made with cream cheese, ham and egg yolk, it tastes very soft, it is ideal for kids.\n",

        "instructions": "1. Preheat oven to 300 degrees.\n2. Combine gingersnaps and melted butter in a Ninja Blender or food processor and run until gingersnaps are crumbly. Press mixture firmly into the bottom of two 6 Springform pans coated with cooking spray. Bake for 15 minutes; cool on a wire rack.\n3. To prepare the filling, using an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Add the sugar then the salt. Beat in the eggs, 1 at a time. Next add the sour cream, lemon juice and zest. Beat until thoroughly mixed. (Make sure you get the cream cheese mixed in from the bottom of the mixing bowl.)\n4. Pour the filling into the two Springform pans. Do not fill to the very top as the mixture expands a little bit. If you have a small amount of mixture left over just bake it in a small baking dish.\n5. Fill an 11x13 (approx.) with water on a lower rack in the oven. On the middle rack, above the water pan, place the two Springform pans. Place in 300* oven for 1 hour and 10 minutes. After 35 minutes, reverse the position of the two pans if they are in two different areas of the oven, such as one in front of the other.\n6. Turn the oven off and leave the cheesecakes in the oven for another hour.  Remove from oven and cool to room temperature on a wire rack.\n7. When cheesecakes are at room temperature, place them in the refrigerator for 8 hours or overnight.\n8. Before removing from pan, use a knife to cut around the pan sides. Then open the clasp on the Springform and release the cheesecake. Place it on a serving plate with the bottom of the Springform pan underneath.\n",
